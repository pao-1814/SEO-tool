Since cryptocurrency loans are secured using cryptocurrency as collateral, bitcoin companies are able to have much more relaxed requirements when it comes to loan approval. A cryptocurrency loan, in contrast, doesn\u0026#039;t require you to stake your real estate or other personal assets. The loaning company needs to make sure that the value of your cryptocurrency can cover any loans in case something happens and you don\u0026#039;t have enough fiat currency for repayment. Blockfi offers ltvs up to 50% and as low as 20%.\u003c/p\u003e     \u003c/aside\u003e     \u003caside\u003e         \u003ca href\u003d\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5cc1a690df4e901766e92dcd/5cea5892c0831c1aaa697d80_btc_loan.jpg\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt\u003d\"How aave brought unsecured borrowing to defi.
