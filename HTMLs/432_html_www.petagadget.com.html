<br>
But you can trace the loss of hegemony back through the last several decades:<br>
<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Military misadventures: The Bay of Pigs, the Vietnam War, the Iran-Contra Affair and the Sandinistas, the Iraq War, and our involvement in the Syrian Civil War. On a smaller scale - reckless drone strikes with unacceptable amounts of collateral damage. So much conflict and loss of life; so little achieved.<br>
<br></li>
<li>Our 2007 MBS blow-up prompted a global recession, specifically because we allowed investment firms to sucker the world into a securities scam based on shoddy credit ratings. Far from fixing that problem, we applied a few haphazard patches that are now being repealed.<br>
<br></li>
<li>We have taken on a lot of foreign debt (which is not necessarily bad as long as it remains comfortably serviceable, which it is), and then complained about it as unfair (which is stupid) and threatened to default on it (which is mind-numbingly awful).<br>
<br></li>
<li>We have shown such poor economic leadership that the world is steadily moving away from petrodollars. Trump's actions are accelerating it - <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-02/iran-just-officially-ditched-dollar">note this under-reported development</a> - but it's a trend going back 20 years (<a href="http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100277620">1999</a>, <a href="http://www.feasta.org/documents/review2/nunan.htm">2003</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Petrodollar-Warfare-Iraq-Future-Dollar/dp/0865715149">2005</a>, <a href="https://www.caseyresearch.com/articles/demise-petrodollar">2012</a>,<br>
<a href="https://dailyreckoning.com/prepare-for-the-death-of-the-petrodollar/">2014</a>, <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-04-23/end-us-dollar-geopolitical-moves-obliterate-us-petrodollar-hegemony">2016</a>, etc.)<br>
<br></li>
<li>We have incessant and growing political, social, and economic problems that, together, dampen the productivity of the nation in a subtle but sweeping way. We're losing our edge in academia and technology. We're exacerbating poverty and failing to elevate standards of education. Despite our vast resources, we are making less productive use of it than ever.<br>
<br></li>
<li>A major problem that we've refused to confront - for 30 years now - is our aging population: the imminent en masse retirement of the Baby Boomers. While forestalled by several years (for reasons that are mostly bad), this shift will require tremendous resources to manage both the needs of the retirees and the vacuum of skilled labor. We can see the consequences of such failures in Japan, which <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/retirement/retire-planning/how-japan-is-coping-with-a-rapidly-aging-population/article27259703/">has struggled with an aging population</a> - and unlike Japan's direct and head-on problem-solving approach, we're letting class warfare and Tea-Party philosophical BS distract us from the problem. The 2020's-2030's will be very difficult times for America as a result of this particular problem.<br></li>

<br>
Whatever the reason for mass extinction, it is clear that it allowed Europeans to <br>
<br></p>
<ol>
<li>have livestock<br></li>
<li>live in very close quarters with livestock species and spread/share diseases, parasites, etc.<br>
<br>
European agriculture was also different from Native American agriculture in that is used livestock for plowing. This was more rough on the earth (for lack of a better word) which is thought to have selected for more tenacious weeds which, when introduced to the Americas, were invasive. <br>

<br>
<strong>Rejection of Results-based Policy Decisions</strong><br>
<br>
I've had many discussions with American Libertarians, and something I always see them do is frame their arguments like so: <br>
<br>
<em>Government Action X is bad because of Distasteful Side-Effect Y. Instead, things should be like Fantasy Scenario Z.</em><br>
<br>
There are several problems with the way this argument is reasoned:<br>
<br></p>
<ul>
<li>When chastising the evils of X and Y, the alternative is not properly considered. Example: "taxation is theft- the government robs you at gunpoint". Ok, what does a society without taxation look like? No law is enforceable in such a system. Rules require resources in order for them to be enforced. Would this be better, or worse than what we've got now?<br>
<br></li>
<li>Fantasy Scenario Z relies on the assumption that some essential piece of human nature magically changes. Example: "Social services are unnecessary because voluntary charity will be sufficient to meet the needs of the poor"- No, we aren't that generous, especially given the current economic circumstances.<br>
<br></li>
<li>The entire argument seems to presume that we would be engaging in a bold new experiment that is destined to produce a more ideal society, when in reality, the world has already been a rich testing ground, and people have been keeping track of what happened. We already have mountains of data, and can actually know what sorts of policies produce what sorts of results. For example, it turns out that if you want a happier, healthier, less criminal, and more educated population, you need to actively install policies that steer the society towards greater equality of wealth. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spirit-Level-Equality-Societies-Stronger/dp/1608190366">Here's a book</a> about analyzing that data.<br>
<br>
I think it really boils down to the fact that we have empirical evidence of policy effects, but Libertarians tend to reject these conclusions for some reason that I don't fully understand. I do grasp that there's a streak of idealism involved there, but I think it's a big mistake to let such idealism cause advocacy for policy that is destined to produce bad results. Even worse, such belief that people will behave in a way that evidence shows they won't behave is bound to be exploited by unscrupulous entities every single time. The bad guys win. Fuck that.</li>

<br>
<br>
Another awful aspect of wealth inequity is that for the past few decades, as business profits have increased greatly, average wages have <a href="http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/bp195/">stagnated</a>. That is against the traditional American view of economic fairness, if that means anything to anyone. Workers' wages are supposed to reflect productivity gains, are they not?<br>

That, and it decreases the entire society's quality of life: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spirit-Level-Equality-Societies-Stronger/dp/1608190366">link</a><br>

They talk about exactly that, capital vs. labor and the effects it's having on society that all wealth gain is going to capital. They also talk about median wages being stagnant since 1979 and falling since 1999. Pretty interesting. It also makes a lot of sense, every time a robot replaces a worker then the value that the robot creates doesn't go to the worker's family but rather to the owner of the robot. That's a huge driving factor behind the wealth inequality we see today and there's more to come. All the wealth generated in transportation will go to Uber instead of being spread across many companies and independent contractors. We'll see that pattern again and again...</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/cryptorchidism</span><span class="c_score"> · 18 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/environment/">r/environment</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>You should read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0300122233">Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</a>.

Ce que le Gouvernement Québécois (Libéral) a fait de bien c'est qu'il a économisé durant une période de richesse économique afin d'avoir un "coussin" pour la prochaine crise qui pourrait avoir lieu... Il faut faire de l'austérité (ou de la rigueur budgétaire) quand les choses vont bien afin d'avoir de l'argent à dépenser quand les choses vont mal pour supporter l'économie.<br>

<br>
Hundreds of years ago, before the industrial age, people worked less than we do now. They worked 'sun up to sun down' only during the harvest or planting times. A farmer also saw his kids for lunch in his own home, and as the kids got to be a bit older, he worked with them on that farm. The mother saw the kids during the day. <br>
<br>
Now parents feel guilty that their kids are raised by others, then feel even more guilty when they are torn between wanting time to themselves at night, vs spending time with the kids, which they know is important. It''s also important to have time to yourself, but this is hard with a 1 hour commute to work every day. <br>
<br>
Then of course the media has you scared shitless than someone will steal your kid, so taking your kid to a park is stressful (if you believe the media). <br>
<br>
And the coup de grace? A kid is a financial burden, unlike they were hundreds of years ago when kids wore hand me down clothes (in today's rat race, this gets you a lot of derision.) and helped do chores on your farm. Today a child is very expensive, which pushes you, at least temporarily, down the financial status ladder. And that status apparently is pretty important, causing us lots of stress.

To make a very long story short, he thought that people could "tame the beast" whereas Hayek believed you could "starve the beast".<br>
<br>
Notice what I'm doing here: I'm discussing the two right wing concepts of neocons and neoliberals. So let's explain what both miss.<br>
<br>
Hayek, being the key figure of private markets and less government, lived with an idealized free market economy. Since the election of Reagan, we've tried that experiment of eliminating government in everything. What Hayek missed was that power can accumulate in more than one form, threatening individual liberty.<br>
<br>
What Hayek missed is the concept of externalities. We tax businesses for societal problems which would be a bad waste of resources. One big example? Oil. We should be taxing it instead of giving it a subsidy. Hayek's main problem is essentially that this is the same work that can be undermined by an Excel error.<br>
<br>
Now let's get into Keynes... They managed the economy well because they had IMMENSE pressure in the 30s from three groups: Communists, Socialists, and unions. Keynes was even a former Marxist who felt that Capitalism could be made more germane. Granted, with so much pressure from below, they had to do something, and Keynesians created a LOT of good ideas that helped out the people. But in the 70s, their ideas became quantitative and complex, pushing them to be cheerleaders of the system of capitalism instead of understanding it.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I like Paul Krugman but reading some of his stuff is needlessly difficult. He talks about interest rates, investments, and all sorts of minutiae which is great but needlessly complicated. That's his job though... Making the layman understand as if his article is an episode of Frazier.<br>
<br>
But let's take Keynesian economics to its extent. Still, it's a neoclassical economic study. What's going to happen in the end?<br>
<br>
Well, unless you fix the problems that progressives ignore, you're going to have a failing of political democracy yet again. And what liberals and conservatives fail to understand is essentially one fundamental flaw of capitalism. It's undemocratic. We have shareholders, who appoint managers, who decide what you produce, where you produce, and how you produce. That's how a capitalist business is formed. <br>
<br>
But think about what is left out here... You have a situation where someone has power over you and what you do. And if you're fired, you're no longer an effective part of your community. You are an employee, with few rights, little access to your government and even fewer chances to speak out. America is tailored to the employer!<br>
<br>
So to me, that's where Keynesians forget or have yet to explore. As a Marxist who went from conservative to libertarian to liberal to Socialist in my life, it just felt that these notions are either ignored or downplayed by most liberals to the detriment of the entire political ideology. I actually enjoy discussions with neoclassical thoughts. I actually like debates. But you have to be honest about the downfalls of schools of thoughts in order to see them strengthened.<br>
<br>
What has occurred in Congress is that the liberals are stuck advocating the same policies of the 1930s. The conservatives are stuck with the same failed policies of 1929. Both schools didn't seem to grow from the 1970s when Keynesian economic theory collapse under stagflation, economists were mainly discussing pure theories instead of reality, and most left wing groups were taken away from schools where they weren't able to become more effective in discussing alternative views.<br>
<br>
Make no mistake, I don't look to discredit Keynes at all and hope I'm being sincere in showing the criticisms I have with right wing economics. What I hope to do here is to show that the main issues is in how it looks to tame capitalism which means it doesn't solve the problems inherent in capitalism that Marx already discussed: class. Not that class is the most important thing, not that it's ineffective. It's just a fact that class is the most ignored part of any economic theory that none other than left wingers talk about... That distinct separation of employer and employee which can undo any gains as evidenced by how most of the New Deal has essentially been undone.<br>

Want some literature? Begin with the obvious, Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World. Next, read up on complex systems theory, maybe take a <a href="https://www.utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/science/introduction-to-complex-systems">course</a> or at least have a look through some of the videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=complex+systems+an+introduction&amp;amp;amp;page=&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=opensearch">here</a>. Having some insight into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=behavioural+economics+a+critical+view">behavioural economics</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_\(social_and_political\)">power dynamics</a> is very useful.<br>
<br>
Then read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manufacturing-Consent-Political-Economy-Media/dp/0099533111/">Manufacturing Consent</a> by Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman, and then <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Necessary-Illusions-Thought-Democratic-Societies/dp/B00LQFBSOU/">Necessary Illusions</a> by the same Chomsky ("<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Understanding-Power-The-Indispensable-Chomsky/dp/B00ID0SL64/">Understanding Power - The Essential Chomsky</a>" is also a good, but long, one) for an overview of the mentioned systemic crimes by those in power, and for a general understanding of how power operates on large scales. Many will discount Chomsky due to his political leanings, I think that's a huge error. The way he argues and presents relies heavily on actual examples and real-world comparisons, and these are useful even if you fundamentally disagree with his political stance (I personally belong on the left of the spectrum, but I do not subscribe to his anarcho-libertarianism or anarcho-syndicalist stances). I also recommend "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Austerity-History-Dangerous-Mark-Blyth/dp/0199389446/">Austerity - The History of a Dangerous Idea</a>" by economist Mark Blyth for this purpose. <br>

Finally, Extra Credits has a good introduction to the concept of gamification with the playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP4_bMhZ4gA&amp;amp;amp;list=PLhyKYa0YJ_5CGkK6JpIagshOH0k4hi3vD">here</a>. At the end, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHcTKWiZ8sI">this video</a> for an introduction to the actual Sesame Credits system in the gamification perspective.<br>
<br>
The field is inherently cross-disciplinary, and "specialisation" in the field is almost a misnomer since the only way to get there, really, is to have a broad (if not deep) understanding of multiple fields, including psychology, pedagogy, linguistics, game design theory, design theory in general, economics, management and leadership theory, complex systems and network analysis, and now it seems politics as well. Some gamification specialists operate in much narrower fields and so do not need this broad an approach (generally, most people in the field operate in teams that contain most of this knowledge), and some of the fields incorporate aspects from the others so you won't have to explicitly study all of them (pedagogy, for example, is in many ways a branch of applied psychology, and game design theory must include lessons on psychology and complex systems).<br>

To add, however, they weren't the only brokerages who made really poor decisions as far as lending. <br>
<br>
You're basically asking "what caused the housing bubble" and the simple answer is <br>
<br></p>
<ol>
<li>banks^1 loaned money to people who shouldn't borrow money because they created ways^2 to securitize (create investable, bettable product) absolutely everything, including the likelihood of risky mortgages being paid back.<br>
<br></li>
<li>Banks create investment vehicles whose risk is not assessed on the basis of whether or not mortgages will get paid or housing prices will drop, but whether or not 30-year mortgages will <em>continue to be paid off every 3 years</em> or <em>whether or not housing prices will continue to rise over 7% a year.</em><br>
<br></li>
<li>People who borrowed money who shouldn't have default on their mortgages (surprising damn near everyone)<br>
<br></li>
<li>Banks that backed these securities based on the risk that housing prices would never, ever, ever go down again end up utterly and completely screwed^3<br>
<br></li>
<li>Governments (not just the US) step in to provide solvency to the market to avert global Thunderdome<br>
<br>
Against that backdrop, FNMA and FLMC aren't exactly minor players, but they're mostly guilty of "me-tooism." The real problem is that while Bear Stearns and Deutsche Bank can fuck up, the government thrifts are, as Latewire mentioned, supposedly overseen (at a more and more and more diminishing level) by the government. In essence, DHL can fuck up and that's a bummer. When the USPS fucks up, there will be congressional inquiries. This does not make their crimes worse. It does not make their crimes better. It does, however, make their crimes more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki">kabuki.</a><br>

<li>For "banks" see "any financial institution, be it a hedge fund, Savings &amp;amp; Loan, insurance firm, what-have-you whose money is made by calculating risk in financial transactions because<br>
<br></li>
<li>Any dividing line between a "bank" and an "insurance" firm was erased with the repeal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act">Glass-Steagall</a><br>
<br></li>
<li>This stuff is actually fascinating reading, particularly to anyone even vaguely interested in finance. My two favorites of the moment are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/I-U-Why-Everyone-Owes/dp/1439169861/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1289058173&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1">IOU</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393072231/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1289058190&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1">The Big Short</a>, both of which are written from a decidedly human perspective and with a great deal of insight. <em>MY</em> takeaway? There's a great line in The Big Short where Michael Lewis compares stock traders and bond traders, saying that stock traders are like exotic island creatures that grew up in an environment with no predators while bond traders tend to be the most ruthless sharks in an environment where "kill or be killed" has been more than an evolutionary pressure, it's been a passionate avocation since the dawn of time. The stock market is regulated due to millions of personal investors such as yourself, which means its behavior is politicized. The bond market, on the other hand, is ruled by large institutions with no oversight who write their own rules and make their money entirely by screwing others. And, frankly, as the stock market is a pimple on the ass of the bond market, and since the "stock price" of a "bond company" is about as meaningless as meaningless could be, investing in FNMA or FLMC without any insider information or a healthy and jaded comprehension of the bond market is pretty much the equivalent of pinning the tail on the donkey and hoping that, rather thank kicking you, it turns around and hands you money.</li>

<br>
As someone who has worked in both the public and private sectors and in organizations both large and small, I have seen firsthand just how inefficient large corporations can be, as well as how much power they can wield. I also know firsthand that every major corporation could not have risen to its current position without the support of a government, either in the form of direct or indirect investment.<br>
<br>
For example, Apple's Siri was originally developed at the <a href="https://www.sri.com/">Stanford Research Institute</a>. Although SRI now takes money from the private sector, it has always received the majority of its funding from the US government. In the USA, recipients of SNAP (aka food stamps) benefits are a significant source of revenue for the major food companies. Defense contractors rely exclusively on the federal government. Pharmaceutical companies would never invest in new drug targets without the NIH funding basic research first.<br>
<br>
So many people believe that government is inefficient and only private, for-profit institutions can deliver goods and services efficiently. Why is this belief so prevalent in the USA?</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/BigFrodo</span><span class="c_score"> · 6 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/AusFinance/">r/AusFinance</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Disclaimer: I'm mid20s guy with less invested in shares than I have in my super.

The lowest barrier to entry would be that "acorns" app but I strongly recommend taking the couple days to make a CMC account or some other online brokerage with low fees and buy ETFS through that instead so that you're actually learning how it all works and not just pressing buttons on an app. Link it up with free Sharesight account for pretty graphs and easy tax reporting and that should teach you more about "having a share portfolio" than the majority of the population.<br>
<br>
Obviously this subreddit and /r/fiaustralia in the sidebar are worth keeping an eye on for insight from people with more skin in the game than me. <br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
Now, the other option is you want to ACTIVELY trade that $1k. If you've read some of Bogle's explanations on why that's a bad idea, realised you'll be competing against people with much bigger budgets and a full time job anaysing these things and understand that even at CMC's low $13 flat fee you're losing 1.3% of your $1k packet with every trade then you'll need advice from someone other than me.<br>
<br>
Personally the best investment I think I have made so far was my $1k of "beer money" that I threw into bitcoin. Not because it made a good return, but because after months of careful analysis, frequent trading and keeping an ear to the ground on new alt coins I turned my 3.5 bitcoin into 1.05. I didn't end up losing a cent thanks to other factors but seeing how badly my "high risk, high gain, actively managed portfolio" went I'm ecstatic that I learned my lesson with $1k and not with my self-managed super fund at 57 y/o like several people I know.<br>

Therefore, situations (such as removing a cigarette from its packaging or choosing lunch from a display) can be <em>designed</em> so that the socially desirable possibility is that which is perceived to require the least amount of effort to achieve.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Alphado</span><span class="c_score"> · 6 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/getdisciplined/">r/getdisciplined</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>I recommend the book <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Action-Treatise-Economics-Set/dp/0865976317/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1412541372">Human Action: A Treatise on Economics (4 Volume Set)</a></strong> by Ludwig von Mises of the Austrian School of Economics.

<br>
---<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;<strong>Kill the corporate income tax</strong><br>
&amp;gt;=============================<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;While the individual income tax is the most harmful tax, the corporate income tax is the dumbest, because the truth of the matter is that corporations don’t pay taxes, they collect taxes. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; Corporations can do three things with their earnings: (1) pay bonuses to their employees, (2) pay dividends to shareholders, or (3) retain the earnings for future expenditures, make capital investments and grow the business. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; When a corporation pays bonuses (of course this applies to all forms of employee compensation), those expenses are deducted, but the recipients pay personal taxes on whatever they receive. So in that respect corporate earnings paid to employees would be taxed even if no corporate income tax existed. Similiarly, when a corporation pays dividends, shareholders pay income taxes at the personal level on their dividend income. Of course, since dividends are not deductible, the corporation also pays the tax at the corporate level as well. To avoid double taxation, many corporations pay no or very low dividends (though this has changed somewhat due to the Bush tax cuts, which temporarily lowered the tax on dividends to 15 percent). Instead they use their earnings to buy back stock. The point is that if we abolished the corporate income tax, corporate income would still be taxed to the extent it was paid out to their employees or shareholders. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; The one exception would be retained earnings. Why would we want to tax retained earnings? Earnings are retained for one purpose, and that is to facilitate the growth of the company. They are used to make capital investments, fund acquisitions, and hire more employees. To the extent that taxation diminishes corporate earning, it diminishes a company’s ability to grow. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; If we simply abolish the corporate income tax, corporations will be better positioned to grow their earnings, which the government could later tax when those higher earnings are paid out to employees and stockholders. In the meantime, the economy would grow and jobs would be created. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; The corporate tax code is another reason why businesses finance so much of their expansion through debt. If a company saves up to buy equipment, it pays taxes on those savings. If it instead borrows to buy equipment, there are no savings to be taxed, and the interest is deductible. Expanding through debt is as legitimate as expanding through savings, but why should our tax code prefer the former? It’s not as if we have too little<br>
debt in our country. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; There’s an emotional appeal to the corporate income tax, though. Corporations aren’t popular. They are the embodiment of evil for many people. It’s nice to think that these evil corporations are paying taxes. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; But corporations don’t pay taxes. Corporate taxes are paid by consumers, employees, or shareholders. All of these are people. So, if you work for a corporation, own stock, or buy anything from a corporation, you are paying a hidden tax. If we abolished corporate income taxes, it’s not as if this would simply benefit corporate profit. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; Some eighty-year-old retired widow collecting dividends is the one paying the corporate income tax, and so she’s paying a 35 percent rate despite living on a cat-food diet and a fixed income. That’s hardly the picture people have of corporate income tax, but that’s the truth.<br></p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Phanes7</span><span class="c_score"> · 6 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/CapitalismVSocialism/">r/CapitalismVSocialism</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>If I was going to provide someone with a list of books that best expressed my current thinking on the Political Economy these would be my top ones: <br>
<br></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Law-Frederic-Bastiat/dp/1940177014/">The Law</a> - While over a century old this books stands as the perfect intro to the ideas of Classical Liberalism. When you understand the core message of this book you understand why people oppose so many aspects of government action.<br></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153/">Seeing Like A State</a> - The idea that society can be rebuilt from the top down is well demolished in this dense but important read. The concept of <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Legibility</a> was a game changer for my brain.<br></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135/">Stubborn Attachments</a> - This books presents a compelling philosophical argument for the importance of economic growth. It's hard to overstate how important getting the balance of economic growth vs other considerations actually is.<br></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breakdown-Nations-Leopold-Kohr/dp/085784430X/">The Breakdown of Nations</a> - A classic text on why the trend toward "bigger" isn't a good thing. While various nits can be picked with this book I think its general thesis is holding up well in our increasingly bifurcated age.<br></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Freedom-Economists-Odyssey/dp/0130621129">The Joy of Freedom</a> - Lots of books, many objectively better, could have gone here but this book was my personal pivot point which sent me away from Socialism and towards capitalism. This introduction to "Libertarian Capitalism" is a bit dated now but it was powerful.<br>
<br>
There are, of course many more books that could go on this list. But the above list is a good sampling of my personal philosophy of political economy. It is not meant as a list of books to change your mind but simply as a list of books that are descriptive of my current belief that we should be orientated towards high (sustainable) economic growth &amp;amp; more decentralization. <br>
<br>
Some honorable mentions: <br>
<br>
As a self proclaimed "Libertarian Crunchy Con" I have to add <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935191500/">The Quest for Community</a> &amp;amp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crunchy-Cons-Birkenstocked-evangelical-homeschooling/dp/1400050642">Crunchy Cons</a><br>
<br>
The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Economy-Inventing-Western-Civilization/dp/0983823200/">The Fourth Economy</a> fundamentally changed my professional direction in life. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/B00A2ZIZYQ/">Anti-Fragile</a> was another book full of mind blowing ideas and shifted my approach to many things.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Jobs-Meaning-9-5/dp/1619613360/">The End of Jobs</a> is a great combination of The Fourth Economy &amp;amp; Anti-Fragile (among other concepts) into a more real-world useful set of ideas. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Markets-Not-Capitalism-Individualist-Inequality/dp/1570272425/">Markets Not Capitalism</a> is a powerful reminder that it is not Capitalism per se that is important but the transformational power of markets that need be unleashed.<br>
<br>
You will note that I left out pure economic books, this was on purpose. There are tons of good intro to econ type books and any non-trained economist should read a bunch from a bunch of different perspectives. With that said I am currently working my way through the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Choice-Cooperation-Enterprise-Human-Action/dp/1598132180/">Choice</a> and if it stays as good as it has started that will probably get added to my core list.<br>
<br>
So many more I could I list like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Left-Right-State-Large-Print/dp/1479301949/">The Left, The Right, &amp;amp; The State</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Political-Authority-Examination-Coerce/dp/1137281650/">The Problem of Political Authority</a> and on it goes... <br>
I am still looking for a "manifesto" of sorts for the broad movement towards decentralization (I have a few possibilities on my 'to read list') so if you know of any that might fit that description let me know.</li>

It's that <em>more</em> buildings (including more tall buildings when all the land has been used up) will lower rents. So New York should also allow more building, for the exact same reason. <br>
<br>
The reason rents are so high is that lots of people want to live in London and New York and regulations (and local neighborhood groups) prevent developers from building enough housing for all of them. Some of the regulations are worth it! Historic preservation, maintaining historic views, etc. really are worth something. But they're not free. Residents pay for it in higher rents. And people who want to move there but can't afford it pay for it in being locked out.<br>
<br>
The concept is laid out in better writing and with more evidence in two short e-books on the subject (not written by me) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rent-Too-Damn-High-Matters-ebook/dp/B0078XGJXO/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1396795981&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=the+rent+is+too+damn+high">here</a> and [here](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gated-City-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B005KGATLO/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1396795981&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;amp;keywords=the+rent+is+too+damn+high">http://www.amazon.com/Gated-City-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B005KGATLO/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1396795981&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;amp;keywords=the+rent+is+too+damn+high</a> "this guy now writes for The Economist").</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/dkesh</span><span class="c_score"> · 4 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/Austin/">r/Austin</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>I don't think "everything needs to be centralized." If people want to live in the suburbs or rural areas, good for them! <br>
<br>
But cities are really awesome and really useful. The state officeworkers probably want some places to eat. This location is literally across the street from a sandwich shop. In addition, there are dozens of other food options within a mile or so. Because there's a big cluster of people working, people have to travel less far to get lunch and they have a wider variety of options. <br>
<br>
All the people who work there would probably like to live nearby where they work. But so would the people who work at the lunch places, and they'd both like to live near where their kids go to school, and their church, etc. If they were far outside the city, at least some of things they'd want would be very far away and harder to access.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on, but if you're interested, I suggest reading the very short <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Gated-City-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B005KGATLO">Gated City</a> by Ryan Avent about the economic benefits of cities or much longer (and more boring) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-City-Greatest-Invention-Healthier/dp/0143120549">Triumph of the City</a> by Edward Glaeser.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/rfry11</span><span class="c_score"> · 4 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/LateStageCapitalism/">r/LateStageCapitalism</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Well, it's available on Google Books free preview, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Entrepreneurial_State.html?id=KQMrCgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;amp;amp;q&amp;amp;amp;f=false">but the pages cut off right before this diagram</a>.

But, to give you an example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery#History">one only needs to look at the Wikipedia page for Li-On batteries</a> to see that that specific invention, while probably funded in part or whole by the DoE, was not an invention of the DoE. So many people, from around the world, contributed knowledge and expertise to create it. It's not a DoE invention.<br>
<br>
The State, especially the US State, is one of the primary catalysts for scientific research, but to say that huge corporations and university systems contribute nothing to that landscape is false. They all take and iterate and innovate on each other, and they all fund each other. Looking at scientific articles and reading their funding sections and delving into their cited references points that out.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/matthewkermit</span><span class="c_score"> · 4 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/AskALiberal/">r/AskALiberal</a></div><div class="c_body"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Amnesia-Government-America-Prosper/dp/1451667833">This is a fantastic book defending the mixed economy.</a> I'd classify this book as center-left.

Neoliberalism hasn't achieved what it was promised to do and people are looking elsewhere for answers. That's what caused Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn, UKIP or the Brexit Party, the Yelow Vests, Donald Trump, and the collapse of "centrist" parties across Europe.<br>
<br>
Mark Blyth, a political economist from Brown university has written about this. He has a good few lectures on YouTube that talk about the topic extensively.<br>

The basic contention thereof is that the reason for the predominance if the dollar is because of some sort of collaboration between the US and OPEC to only seen oil in dollars, and that the US attacks anyone who ever tried to deviate.<br>
<br>
Of course, the issue is that there are countries who seek oil in currency other than the dollar--including counties the US is extremely close to (Canada and the UK), and the volume of trade that's done in the dollar that has little or nothing to do with oil. (The vast majority of trade)<br>
<br>
After a cursory examination, you've got to become skeptical about where this theory originates from because is the weaknesses in the theory--and in this case this theory originates from a curious source: A guy named <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Petrodollar-Warfare-Iraq-Future-Dollar/dp/0865715149">Richard Clarke</a>, who turns out to be an IT guy, not an actual economist or political scientists. <br>
<br>
In the field nobody thinks that the petrodollar warfare hypothesis has any merit. It's basically the mad fantasy of a guy who didn't like George Bush. It's really disregarded, except for the inexplicable popularity it has on the internet.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Bartleby1955</span><span class="c_score"> · 4 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/news/">r/news</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>I agree with the first part of this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-End-Work-Decline-Post-Market/dp/0874778247">The End of Work:.... </a>, I don't think I'll be around for the second part.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/satanic_hamster</span><span class="c_score"> · 4 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/CapitalismVSocialism/">r/CapitalismVSocialism</a></div><div class="c_body"><p><strong>Socialism/Communism</strong><br>

I have a <em>hard</em> time believing that the people currently in control of the vast majority of our current capital will allow this to happen in any calm and reasonable way. Here's basically how I see this playing out in the US:<br>
<br></p>
<ol>
<li>Robots will start taking over a <em>lot</em> of jobs. Like 60% of them in the next 20-30 years.^1<br></li>
<li>Politicians (and the wealthy) will continue their rhetoric of "hard work instead of handouts".<br></li>
<li>There will be no jobs to replace the lost jobs.^2<br></li>
<li>We'll hit something like 50%-60% unemployment, with (more) people starving in the streets.<br></li>
<li>The riots will start, tending toward revolution.<br></li>
<li>If we're really, really lucky, we'll get universal basic income in place <em>before</em> the US has its own, personal Bastille day. <br></li>
<li>After revolution, we will be on UBI and tending toward post-scarcity.<br>
<br>
It's that middle bit, stages 4-6, that I'm worried about. I'm excited for stage 7, but I don't see how we're going to get there without a <em>big fucking mess</em>. Here are some other people who agree with me that, unless we do some things now that the hyper-rich don't seem into, we're going to have a lot of "fun" with stages 4-6:<br>
<br></li>

And the problem is that the hyper-rich are controlling US leadership, and, again, it is against their personal (short-term) interest to prevent this problem. Seriously, watch that TED talk.<br>

If you are interested in any specific sub-genre of environmental history I can give you more detailed recommendations - history of environmentalism, history of conservation, enviro-tech, environment and gender, environment and race, urban environmental history, etc. etc. etc.<br>
<br>
If you want to start in the places the field started I would go with William Cronnon's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Changes-Land-Indians-Colonists-Ecology/dp/0809016346">Changes in the Land</a> - it's an environmental history of the colonization of New England, and is still excellent, although it has been disputed, revised, and corrected by a variety of historians on points big and small (as happens with any classic work of history over time!).</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Vorpal_Hammer</span><span class="c_score"> · 3 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/AskSocialScience/">r/AskSocialScience</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>I found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economix-Economy-Works-Doesnt-Pictures/dp/0810988399">Economix</a> very helpful as a basic sort of primer.

<br>
TL;DR: the poor are poor because they have a culture marked by high time preference in all aspects of their life. They live in the moment, not planning ahead. This precludes investing, deprecates long-range planning and goal setting, such as going to college and finding a good job. They also don't take care of capital they do have, they are poor stewards and thus cannot accumulate it. This manifests in things like not changing your oil and then being surprised when your car quits on you.<br>
<br>
They spend disproportionately on luxury items, in stark contrast to the poor from say Asia whom came here, saved and scrimped, opened businesses, and whose children all became highly-educated professional workers in a generation.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/JackGetsIt</span><span class="c_score"> · 3 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/TheRedPill/">r/TheRedPill</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Talk to people more.

If you're the smartest highest status person in the room get out of the room. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; I wonder, how to determine what status a girl is<br>
<br>
If she's overly concerned with status. She's low or middle status. If she's well spoken and doesn't offend easily she's higher status.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt; Are there different rules in communication depending on the statuses of a girl?<br>
<br>
Yes and no. Redpill applies across all social and political spectrums but every group has a set of secret rules that outsiders don't pick up on. This helps to create in group out group dynamics. <br>
<br>
I highly recommend these two books on the subject of status and class mindsets.<br>

<br>
&amp;gt; Is applying these rules the same as holding the frame of high status?<br>
<br>
No. You could play all your cards right and if a girl is in a different class/status position you're out of the running. It's all about handling these situations with grace and establishing connections and friendships. Holding frame is not a guarantee of landing particular target. Holding frame just ups your chances in general and also wins male friendships which helps you grow a social group which increase your chance of getting laid. Men respect other men that hold frame.<br></p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/FANGO</span><span class="c_score"> · 3 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/worldnews/">r/worldnews</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Luck is automatically equalized.

Also, education, in countries where they have functioning public education systems and free college for everyone who wants/qualifies for it, that sort of thing, is not simply acquired through wealth.

It is basically a question of when you want access to the money. <br>
<br>
You create a regular account, and IRA or a Roth IRA (assuming you make less than $193k) <br>
<br>
The regular account you put you after tax money in, and you can take it out whenever you want. You pay taxes on the income and when you sell you will pay capital gains on any appreciation. <br>
<br>
&amp;amp;#x200B;<br>
<br>
The Iras are accounts meant for retirement so you can't take money out until retirement age. With the IRA you put Pre tax money in with the Roth after tax money in. IRA deferes the taxes on income and gains. Roth you can take out without tax. but again at retirement age. There is a lot more info on here about the differences but that is the TLDR version. <br>
<br>
&amp;amp;#x200B;<br>
<br>
Now that you have picked the TYPE of account (Regular/IRA/Roth) you have a choice of what to invest in. you can invest in many many things almost anything. but a solid simple and many would say best choice over the long term is the simple index fund with low fees. &amp;lt;.1 % <br>
<br>
&amp;amp;#x200B;<br>
<br>
In summary you would buy the index fund in your roth IRA account if that was your choice. There is a done of good summary info tagged in here so that is a good place to start learning more or can pick up a book or two at the library this is a good one.<br>

Let me say something about market dynamics.<br>
<br>
The median salary in the United States is about $26k/year. The median household income is about $48k/year (nowadays often with 2 adults working).<br>
<br>
Now let me direct you to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gated-City-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B005KGATLO/ref=pd_sim_kstore_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2">this book</a>, which provides much of the detail for my point. The greater the inequality, the more you will see "bubbles" (with a long-term tidal trend) driving up the prices of productive capital assets, or indeed of simply living near productive assets.<br>
<br>
Because remember, sellers of capital assets aren't going to sell "Wal-Mart-grade" cheaper versions of stocks or bonds or index funds. We already had a housing bubble driven by the Wal-Martization of housing and the migration away from productive cities into cheap but unproductive hinterlands (see link). And even with the new crowd-funding law, you still need a lot of money and financial knowledge to do equity investment in early-stage start-up companies.<br>
<br>
So the purchasing power of "the rich" (really: any given wealthy individual) on capital-asset markets rises with inequality (the degree to which <em>this</em> individual can outbid <em>everyone else</em>). With increased relative purchasing power will come increased prices and increased catering by the market towards that segment of buyers, as dictated by normal laws of supply and demand.<br>
<br>
Thus, increasing inequality allows the rich to price everyone else out of access to productive capital. In layman's terms, increasing inequality means that starting an entry-level job at $80k/year in the Boston area only allows you to live in a one-bedroom apartment or with roommates, because housing prices have gotten so high that you need a six-figure (let's call that top-20%) income to afford your own house. This happened to me. Meanwhile, the folks across the state in Greenfield can't get jobs, and dream of how they would own the entire town if they made $80k/year.<br>
<br>
Really, I should have used Manhattan as the example <em>par excellence</em>, but I didn't work or live in Manhattan.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/NimbleBodhi</span><span class="c_score"> · 3 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/Bitcoin/">r/Bitcoin</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>I'd recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central-ebook/dp/B07BPM3GZQ/">reading his book</a>, it's very insightful.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/sealpoint33</span><span class="c_score"> · 3 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/Bitcoin/">r/Bitcoin</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Available on Kindle: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central-ebook/dp/B07BPM3GZQ/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?keywords=the+bitcoin+standard&amp;amp;amp;qid=1567309466&amp;amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1">https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central-ebook/dp/B07BPM3GZQ/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?keywords=the+bitcoin+standard&amp;amp;amp;qid=1567309466&amp;amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1</a></p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/justgetoffmylawn</span><span class="c_score"> · 2 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/IWantToLearn/">r/IWantToLearn</a></div><div class="c_body"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B0041842TW">Four Pillars of Investing</a> is a great introduction to index investing and how to build consistent lifelong returns.

It’s a meta-analysis of 47 prior studies, and the results, <br>
&amp;gt;“…approximately 245000 deaths in the United States in 2000 were attributable to low education, 176000 to racial segregation, 162000 to low social support, 133000 to individual-level poverty, 119000 to income inequality, and 39000 to area-level poverty … The estimated number of deaths attributable to social factors in the United States is comparable to the number attributed to pathophysiological and behavioral causes.” <br>
<br>
If you don't want to read the paper, the New York Times has <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/article?a=812624&amp;amp;amp;single=1&amp;amp;amp;f=26">coverage here</a>. The upshot of this study is well stated by the author in his New York Times interview. I’ll simply quote him, <br>
&amp;gt;“In some ways the question is not ‘Why should we think of poverty as a cause of death?’ but rather ‘Why should we not think of poverty as a cause of death?’ If you say that 193,000 deaths are due to heart attack, then heart attack matters. If you say 300,000 deaths are due to obesity, then obesity matters. Well, if 291,000 deaths are due to poverty and income inequality, then those things matter too.”<br>
<br>
A lot of scientists and researchers in the United States have a tendency to overlook social factors (poverty, discrimination, barriers to access) when considering negative health outcomes (thinking mainly of personal choices such as smoking and exercise, and genetics), but the evidence is mounting that these factors are not just at least as significant, but actually more significant than the traditional individual risk factors (smoking, seat belt use, etc). About half of any person's health is already programmed by the time they are 2-years-old, and social factors (poverty, racism, mom's maternity experience -- whether she was working two fulltime jobs as a single expectant mom, etc -- are hugely significant).<br>
<br>
Having lived in West Africa, I can tell you there is definitely a lot of poverty there. Many days I was without running water or electricity. I can also tell you that there is a lot of poverty here in the US. A well known Harvard researcher famously published a study that demonstrated that black men in our nation's capitol had shorter life expectancies than their counterparts in Ghana; this seems pretty fucked up, since I've lived in Ghana (see my aforementioned comment about lack of running water and electricity). I loved my time in Ghana, but it makes me ashamed that the health outcomes would be worse for our own citizens in a country that is many decades ahead of Ghana with respect to infrastructure. A New England Journal of Medicine study found that <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199001183220306">black men in Harlem have a shorter life expectancy than their counterparts in Bangladesh</a>, again a scandalously tragic finding, since Bangladesh is quite poor. <br>
<br>
So, in summary, although poverty and inequality are the root of much of the world's health problems, and while Africa in general does have a lot of both -- I can assure you of two things: we have plenty of poverty and inequality within the United States, and as a result, we have very poor health outcomes (50th in the world for life expectancy, 45th in the world for infant mortality, etc). <br>
<br>
Sorry for such a long post -- I made this account a while back to occasionally post something about structural violence (the academic term that refers to the cause of these sort of deaths; deaths that occur when there is no person or direct behavioral violence to blame), and although I know this post will get lost in the shuffle, it was about time I actually wrote something meaningful here.

Things like commodities are essentially the same way, sunlight is useful for creating energy but because it isn't scarce it has no monetary value, but something like oil which require work to get from the ground and refine to make usable energy, it then has value because of its scarcity. Bitcoin is in the same vein where it creates a digital entity that is scarce while also being digital which was never done before without a controlling 3rd party.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/JeffB1517</span><span class="c_score"> · 2 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/investing/">r/investing</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Book I generally recommend as a 1st book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B0041842TW">https://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B0041842TW</a><br>

I don't quite understand what the EO for the federal hiring freeze is trying to accomplish; I suspect it's intended to pave the way for contractors to start fulfilling jobs previously filled by federal employees instead of actually trying to cut down on labor costs in the Fed, particularly as those labor costs seems to amount to a rather insignificant portion of the budget.

RE: The TPP, I was pretty swayed by the arguments against put forward in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economix-Economy-Works-Doesnt-Pictures/dp/0810988399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1485200336&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=economix">Economix</a> and the concern of business entities being able to pursue litigation against sovereign nations for "inhibiting profits". On the other hand, global trade generally does help ours and other economies, although there is and has been plenty of abuse due to the lack of oversight in how trade is conducted. I am really sympathetic to the loss of domestic manufacturing jobs and its impact on lower and middle classes, but at the same time I think it's an inevitable outcome given the availability of labor globally.<br>
<br>
Overall, I am severely distrustful of this administration acting in the best interest of the middle and lower class. Given the trend of growing economic inequity in the last four decades, this is particularly troubling.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/richie5um</span><span class="c_score"> · 2 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/booksuggestions/">r/booksuggestions</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>It may not be the style you are looking for, but I liked Economix (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economix-Economy-Works-Doesnt-Pictures/dp/0810988399">http://www.amazon.com/Economix-Economy-Works-Doesnt-Pictures/dp/0810988399</a>).</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Dogbeefporklamb</span><span class="c_score"> · 2 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/DepthHub/">r/DepthHub</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Nice post Noamsky!<br>

&amp;gt;U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research member and International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard has said, there is no real evidence: "All the models we have seen impose the neutrality of money as a maintained assumption. This is very much a matter of faith, based on theoretical considerations rather than on empirical evidence."[8] Recognition of the short-run non-neutrality of money led to the development of the New Keynesian class of macroeconomic models.<br>
Empirical studies have shown that money is neutral in the long-run.[9] Nonetheless, it is also true that the way in which money is supplied today, i.e. through debt, is actually affecting the economy and pushing for growth, both in the short and in the long run (see Critics to fractional reserve banking). It can therefore be argued that while sound money is neutral over the long term, <strong>fiat money</strong> is not.<br>
<br>
That is, our current fiat based monetary system, the currency is not neutral in the long term. This is one of the base arguments for Austrians. Our current system pretty much assumes that is true despite very little to no evidence. Its an interesting debate nevertheless. If you want to read more on Mises, specifically on Money and Credit (he wrote a lot about human interaction in the market place, as well as politics and monetary systems), i would suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Money-Credit-Works-Ludwig/dp/0913966703">The Theory of Money and Credit - 1912</a>. But personally, my favorite book by Mises is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Action-Ludwig-von-Mises/dp/0865976317/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1346769398&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=human+action">Human Action - 1949</a>.<br></p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/LiTeRaLlYsHaKiNgNoW</span><span class="c_score"> · 2 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/AskThe_Donald/">r/AskThe_Donald</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>I had to read this book in college a long time ago:<br>

His prediction turned out to be inaccurate at least for the time being. The prediction was that automation due to computers would cause people to lose jobs beginning in the 2000s. This didn't actually happen, but that doesn't mean it still can't happen now.<br>
<br>
His solution to the problem was reduce the work week. The work week used to be 80, it was dropped to 60, and then again to 40. They were going to reduce it to 30 during The Great Depression, I believe, but it never went through.<br>
<br>
It's a theoretically simple solution, obviously if people can't work as much you'll need to employ more people. The issue though is whether they'll actually be able to make enough on something like, say, 30 hours in order to survive. Automation should theoretically mean cheaper products and a lower cost of living, though. China has a 3D printer that prints out entire houses that sell for $5000 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2014/apr/29/3d-printer-builds-houses-china-video">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2014/apr/29/3d-printer-builds-houses-china-video</a> . <br>
<br>
Really, though, people have been saying automation is going to cause large-scale unemployment for ages now and it has yet to happen. That book was predicting it two decades ago.

But in the future, the day would still come when they reach disastrous levels.

But beyond the negative impact of just another consumer, we are here to teach us all that the way we've been living is reaching a breaking point.

He is very convincing as he explains why duplexes, triplexes, and quads are better money makers than single family homes. Convincing enough that I bought a duplex that was zoned for single family, duplex, or commercial. I went over rent scenarios with my realtor (who is now my property manager) and she and her colleagues agreed that I could get $2200 rent total as a duplex (1 bed and 2 bed units) but only 1500-1600 as a 3 bedroom house. So I make enough on it that I can pay manager 10% and still have a good profit, plus she does all the work.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Raydr</span><span class="c_score"> · 2 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/RealEstate/">r/RealEstate</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>I recommend this book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Investing-Duplexes-Triplexes-Quads-Fastest/dp/1419537253">Investing in Duplexes, Triplexes, and Quads</a></p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/mferna9</span><span class="c_score"> · 2 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/MilitaryFinance/">r/MilitaryFinance</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Absolutely! We've never had much money, so we always tried to find ways to get into each with with little to no money out of pocket. Overall, we've been able to do that pretty well- most deals we bring $2K or less to closing. We sort of stumbled upon our first property. It was a double in a great neighborhood that needed A LOT of work. I actually called the sign because we were looking for a place to rent and found out it was for sale. We got an FHA 203K (renovation) loan to purchase it and fix it up. Since we did much of the work ourselves, we ended up getting a great deal on it and it cashflows really well! While fixing it up I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Investing-Duplexes-Triplexes-Quads-Fastest/dp/1419537253/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?keywords=investing+in+doubles%2C+triplexes&amp;amp;amp;qid=1554388899&amp;amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0">this book</a> and it completely shifted my mindset and helped lay out a plan moving forward. Next we used the VA loan for the 4-plex, which also needed a lot of work. Same thing, we lived in one unit and fixed up the ones that needed to be completely renovated. Most people don't realize you can use the VA loan for multi-family. As long as you live in one of the units, you can use it for up to 4 units (can get 5 or more units if 2 or more eligible vets are in on the deal). The property can also have commercial space as well, but it is restricted to a certain % of the square footage- I don't remember the exact number off the top of my head. After the 4-plex, my wife wanted a regular house, we we bought a house for us to live in. Bad idea in my eyes because it slowed us down and restricted cashflow, but happy wife happy life, right? lol. From here it got tougher because we couldn't use primary residence financing anymore (VA, FHA, etc.) and had to find creative ways to make deals happen. For me the easiest way has been finding properties that need a good bit of work and using renovation loans from local banks- they typically will lend up to 80-90% of the AFTER repair value, so if the deal is good enough you can finance the whole thing without any money out of pocket. The next one was a SFH we scooped up really cheap at an auction. Starting bid was 50% of the appraised value from the local government and somehow I was the only one who bid on it. Put 10% down and we had 30 days to get the rest of the financing. We got the rest of the money ($35,000) from a hard money guy until I can refinance with a bank.<br>

Sorry for the long response, and I'm happy to dive deeper into anything you have questions about. I'd say the biggest success factors for us were 3 things: 1) cashflow is king. When times get tough, cashflow (and reserves) will keep the house of cards from falling over (especially when you're playing with little skin in the game like we do). 2) You have to be disciplined and plan on not using any of the money you make for personal stuff. The more you can reinvest, the faster you can grow. 3) Don't be afraid to pull the trigger. A lot of people get cold feet. Know your numbers and when the right deal pops up, don't be afraid to take the plunge.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/clark_ent</span><span class="c_score"> · 2 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/RealEstate/">r/RealEstate</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419537253/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;tag=amazon0311f6-20&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=1419537253">Investing in Duplexes, Triplexes, and Quads</a>...they talk about doing exactly what you're talking about.

<br>
No. If no one owns the means of production in socialism(which is its definition), then there is no exchange in capital goods, labor, and factors of production. If theres no exchange, then theres no prices. Therefore there are <em>no prices whatsoever</em> to be "managed".<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;state action is intrinsically socialist<br>
<br>
Yes but to what degree matters. A government organization in a fairly capitalist system can acquire capital from private markets based on their <em>market</em> prices and has <em>some</em> idea about the costs involved in providing public goods and services(although not as efficient as markets). <br>
<br>
A socialist system has no frame of reference of market prices, and thus cannot rationally allocate resources, This is the framework of Mises' calculation problem.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;but you offer compelling arguments against Keynesianism being socialist. However, clearly, Keynesianism is not a free market ideology, but also not a #realsocialism ideology either, so I suppose it deserves its' own ideological catalog?<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;Would you consider Keynesianism capitalist? <br>
<br>
Keynesianism, at least as an economic theory(and not as a policy framework) can exist in a perfectly free market. The free banking school has similarities in both Keynesianism and Austrianism.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt; the feeling I've been having lately of distinguishing free markets from capitalism.<br>

No, I never intended to imply that it would fix <strong>everything</strong>. <br>
<br>
Today, the immediate problem is that there aren't enough jobs because business isn't spending. There is an entity that <strong>can</strong> spend without worrying about profit; indeed this is its mandate, in my opinion. This is the government. Ergo, it ought to spend this economy by purchasing everything made until such point that private businesses or consumers start spending again. <br>

Ignore anything before 1865. That is not the stick to measure against for historical records as the structure of the economy was wildly different.

It can go higher, sure. That isn't necessarily a good thing though and, given the constraints we've put on ourselves into, it won't be nearly as manageable without drastic restructuring.<br>

<br>
No, because a) it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion, b) I have other things to do and c) I am more than aware of MMT, Keynsian economics and the drawbacks of austerity already.<br>

<br>
It's not from the news, it's basic economics. Removing control of a countries currency takes away their greatest tool in combating recessions and downturns. Not having your own currency also makes you puppet to the decisions of your new central bank as explained below. <br>
<br>
When the downturn happened and it's subsequent bailouts the EU turned private debt into public debt and then issued it to everyday people in the name of austerity programs. Then tried to restart the system with permanent liquidity through the central bank to the sum of 13 trillion dollars in the bond market and 10 trillion in fiscal support. They've now generated somewhere in the ballpark of 40 trillion dollars worth of negative yielding assets. Certainly sounds like a system that is performing well right? It get's worse. <br>
<br>
Now that you've injected massive amounts of capital into the system, where is the inflation? Look at the wage share of GDP in the Eurozone. Capital share has gone up, and labor share has plummeted. The only thing keeping it going now is massive liquidity injections and bond purchases all falling squarely on the backs of the taxpayer. <br>
<br>
The EU get's high marks here, because real wages in the eurozone are rising again ever so slightly because your Germans overlords have kept a lid on it through their own strong unions. <br>
<br>
Where does that leave us. Now we have more capital in the market than can be invested, and the pool continues to grow. The average age of Europe continues to rise, now at 44 years old. I only point that out as old people tend to prefer conservative policies of low inflation due to fixed incomes, furthering current policy trends. The flaws exposed in the political and economic union within the EU during the downturn should fill you with terror, and have you praying that it never happens again. However the current conditions being created by your central bank make that event as close to a statistical certainty.<br>
<br>
I don't get my economic knowledge from the news, but it sounds like you do. Traveling around Europe gives you exactly zero knowledge or expertise on the subject. <br>

It's bed time for me and while my tone has been mostly argumentative, I need to concede a few points. I have to admit that the US is heading for single payer healthcare, and the prospect of knowing that no citizen will face dying or financial ruin due to the unavailability of healthcare coverage fills my cold heart with joy. I just want it's implementation to be economically viable and sustainable. This half hearted shit with the ACA won't work anymore. </p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/metafork</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/AskReddit/">r/AskReddit</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Nope...its from Nudge <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0300122233">http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0300122233</a></p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/FloorPlan</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/politics/">r/politics</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Lol who said anything about czars being new?

The book I mentioned a few comments up, "Debt, the first 5000 years" talks about different ways people interact. The pure communist ideal is pretty much how people used to behave in small communities - there literally wasn't a concept of property per se. But it also makes it obvious why it's so unsuited for our much larger, urban communities.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt; why should a group of people elect someone to control the group when the same group can control itself directly and democratically?<br>
<br>
Can the group control itself directly and democratically? What would a group of southern folks would do if they found a gay nigger living with them? What would people in a village in Uganda do if they found out the photographer that arrived yesterday is a militant atheist?<br>
<br>
But you're right, we are much farther from this end of the spectrum. Right now we need a lot more direct democracy, not less. <br>

CDS can apply to a lof to things, but the pension funds that bought CDOs from Wall St were not the firms who bought CDS on the same securities from AIG. AIG's CDS were used by Wall St to create synthetic CDOs (CDOs with no real underlying mortgages), and were bought by investment banks and hedge funds. Pension funds got blown up when their CDO went to zero. Goldman, who sold them the CDOs, made money because Goldman (and hedge funds like John Paulson who personally made $4B in the crash) held CDS from AIG.<br>

I recommend reading The Big Short by Michael Lewis to get a more comprehensive understanding than the video. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393072231">http://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393072231</a><br>

<br>
Again it's the intention of the actors.<br>
<br>
When you are raising kids, you have to have them buy into the system you are running, otherwise they will spend most of their time working around the rules you establish. Rules can't stop bad actors. Enforcement of punishment for bad actors stops bad actors.<br>
<br>
The only real solution is to confront or replace bad actors. The beauty is that people external to the US will eventually be more effective than the domestic audience in doing this as the US loses ground internationally do to the short term policies pursued by these interests. The elite in the US that would natural counter-balance things domestically lack the courage and character so far to even effectively rebuke their fellow elites.<br>
<br>
The bad news is that domestically life will just get worse for most people in the interim. <br>
<br>
Clearly identifying bad actors and their backers with public evidence, followed by effective group action, namely boycotts of the corporations responsible, and the construction of competing businesses is a good start. There is a lot of wasted money and brainpower in the current insane direction of the country. The solution is to tap into that, rather than have it continue unchallenged. Doing things like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393072231">the Big Short</a> is a positive step in the right direction.<br>

We have a multi-dimensional problem.

This one was great as well, but also pay walled.

<br>
This one isn’t pay walled! You should definitely take a look, they mention UBI, but it was published from a law school, not an economics institute or think tank. “Technology, unemployment &amp;amp; policy options: Navigating the transition to a better world” by Gary Marchant, Stevens, and Hennessy which appeared in the Journal of Evolution and Technology<br>

This one was incredibly informed, shows more figures and evidence in an easily-understandable way than I’ve seen elsewhere. “The impact of technological change on jobs and workforce structures” by Chandon Bezuidenhout, published by the Gordon Institute of Business Science<br>

<br>
EDIT: so how will you persuade me that technological unemployment isn’t a problem??<br>
<br>
I need evidence that shows conclusively that other factors are more important than automation in causing job losses and depressing wages since the 1970s. Or evidence that shows more jobs were created since the 1970s than phased out because of new technology.<br>
<br>
Not sure how you could calm me down about Artificial Intelligences since they aren’t exactly around to test yet. Perhaps you could send me evidence for why the AI industry will not face accelerated technological research and development? Could you send me evidence for why the labor replacement potential of AI is overblown, maybe because their advancement has some kind of natural ceiling or impediment somehow?<br>
<br>
The historical precedent of new job creation following technological destruction of jobs doesn’t seem to have kept up since the 1970s and 1980s, and seems like enough evidence for why we should be skeptical it’ll pop up some time in the future but because it popped up in the 1950s and earlier in the century. What conclusive evidence is there that Artificial Intelligence isn’t a game changer for our economy? Obviously you can’t use evidence from before there were computers for such a rebuttal. There’s no good comparison for AIs in history to use for economic predictions other than computers. It’s a tough road to persuade someone that machine intelligences will always be inferior to humans. That’s a nice story but it’s entirely based on treating Hollywood movies like real life</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Sazabi24</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/AskEconomics/">r/AskEconomics</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Probably this: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies/dp/0393350649">https://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies/dp/0393350649</a></p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/eletta</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/UCSD/">r/UCSD</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>The one that's making the rounds at work is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies/dp/0393350649/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;amp;sr=">The Second Machine Age</a>.

<br>
Actually, minimum wages have been shown to cause job losses: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/business/economy/seattle-minimum-wage.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/business/economy/seattle-minimum-wage.html</a><br>
<br>
The Berkeley study covered restaurant workers only. A different University of Washington study compiled data from all sectors in Seattle, and showed far worse results:<br>
<br>
<em>The University of Washington researchers found that the minimum-wage increase resulted in higher wages, but also a significant reduction in the working hours of low-wage earners. This was especially true of the more recent minimum-wage increase, from as high as $11 an hour to up to $13 an hour in 2016. In that case, wages rose about 3 percent, <strong>but the number of hours worked by those in low-wage jobs dropped about 9 percent — a sizable amount that led to a net loss of earnings on average.</strong></em><br>
<br>
Yeah surely the rents don't help, but if you make the minimum wage $100/hour, you will have fewer jobs. This is econ 101 stuff.<br>

It's not really a question of when, it's already happening.<br>
<br>
Consider how:<br>
<br>
Turbotax and automated payroll systems have replaced a significant % of accounting positions<br>
<br>
Wall St firms need fewer employees because most trading is now automated<br>
<br>
Highly automated Amazon warehouses means fewer employees are needed for retail and malls shut down<br>
<br>
Law firms now need fewer new associates and paralegals due to legal software<br>
<br>
Universities can hire fewer teaching assistants due to educational software<br>
<br>
In the ports of NYC and worldwide a few engineers controlling robotic cranes have replaced tens of thousands of longshoreman unloading and loading ships<br>
<br>
Many newer behemoth companies like Facebook and Google are worth far more than old guard firms like GM or Walmart but require only a few hundred to a few tens of thousands of human employees...<br>
<br>
And technological progress isn't slowing down, it is speeding up. Think of the approximately 20 million drivers who will be almost surely out of a job within the next 2 decades as self driving cars and trucks hit the roads.<br>
<br>
Yes there will still be jobs, but a surprising number of them are being and will continue to be automated, at an ever increasing rate. One cashier watching 10 self-checkout scanners replacing ten cashiers is a good example of the jobs that might still require humans... until you replace her too with a robot.<br>
<br>
Neither tariffs nor high minimum wages will change this trend. UBI is really the only long term solution.<br>

There is another book (albeit very repetitive and boring) called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Long-Emergency-Converging-Catastrophes-Twenty-First/dp/0802142494/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;amp;qid=1222178223&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1">The Long Emergency: Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century</a> by the blogger <a href="http://www.kunstler.com/">James Howard Kunstler</a> that puts the emphasis on the oil shortage rather than violence who breaks the country down into regions and discusses the pros and cons of each. One of his contentions is that the best type of place to live would be a small town surrounded by agricultural farmland with an ample water supply (or at least enough rainfall to grow crops without irrigation) and with a comfortably long growing season. Kunstler claims that the New England or Appalachia area would be the best, but of course he is an Easterner. I would have thought you would have picked Northern Idaho where you would have a much greater percentage of allies than most other places, although according to Kunstler the growing season in Northern Idaho is too short to sustain life in the long term. There is also Vermont and New Hampshire where the <a href="http://freestateproject.org/">Free State Project</a> is centered, but it's verrrrrrry cold in the winter I'm told. Speaking of cold, I think my pick by a country mile would be Alaska if it weren't for the harsh winters. If global warming would hurry up and arrive I would head for Alaska (despite Palin!).<br>

P.S.<br>
<br>
Are you aware that Texas is one of only six states that have banned open carry? I was astounded when I learned of this yesterday morning on <a href="http://constitutionpreservation.org/">Michael Badnarick's</a> radio program <a href="http://mp3.wtprn.com/Badnarik08.html">Lighting the Fires of Liberty</a>. It was pointed out by one of his guest hosts who was knowledgeable in this area. Apparently the popular perception of the Second Amendment in Texas is far different than the reality.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/daveinacave</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/EmergencyManagement/">r/EmergencyManagement</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>A great book on situational awareness called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Left-Bang-Marine-Combat-Program/dp/1936891301/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1449330920&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=left+of+bang">Left of Bang</a><br>

<br>
Wrong. If you have to buy oil in a foreign country's currency, you have to buy that currency first, then buy the oil. You will always lose value in the exchange. In fact, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Petrodollar-Warfare-Iraq-Future-Dollar/dp/0865715149">Iraq War may have been started to ensure the world's oil supply continues to be priced in American dollars and not Euros.</a> <br>

Automation will affect China and India less, because the citizens of those countries are not used to the standard of living Americans have enjoyed as a result of being less than 4% of the world's population but holding over 30% of the world's wealth. Globalization and automation will level the standard of living across the world; what that means is that as life for Indians and Chinese improves, life for Americans gets worse. <br>
<br>
The ethnic divides in America have been kept assuaged by the bouyant economy and petrodollar; once those tank, the fissures in society will erupt and America will implode into a violent racial, ethnic, and religious civil war with horrific casualties. </p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/roadkill6</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/politics/">r/politics</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>You are all kinds of confused about what a Libertarian is, son. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libertarianism-Primer-David-Boaz/dp/068484768X">Read up</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">subject</a> and get back to me.

Savings are only good if they are invested in something that will provide returns. Since demand has slackened globally (meaning no/low returns and high risk), a lot of these savings are just sitting there, doing nothing. Look at the price of assets - they have increased massively because people are parking their money, hoping they don't lose it in a crash.<br>
<br>
You don't understand the causes of the global downturn. I'm not going to spell them out for you here, other than to say that (a lack of) demand was/is not the problem, but rather a misallocation of resources (i.e, malinvestments) because there was <em>too much</em> demand in the wrong sectors relative to savings, brought on by artificially low interest rates (e.g, the housing market). <br>
<br>
The solution is simple: Let the market set interest rates (i.e, way up). This will purge the economy of its malinvestments, and encourage more people to save. Businesses and entire sectors that are being artificially propped up by cheap money (e.g, financials, and housing), businesses that are supposed to fail because of their inefficiency or unprofitability will fail, and that lost wealth will be diverted into the strong, profitable sectors. <br>
<br>
Until this happens, the US and the UK will never, ever have a proper recovery. Trying to get people to spend their meager savings is the exact wrong thing to do. That's what got us into this mess, it's not what's going to get us out. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; You're talking about Structural Unemployment. The vast majority of economists are in agreement that it exists. In capitalism, industries are created and destroyed all the time. The people in the destroyed industries are not automatically retrained for the new industries when made redundant. This leads to a certain percentage of the population that are unable to get work. It's a natural part of capitalism.<br>
<br>
Fine, but mass unemployment WILL NOT HAPPEN in a free market (because there will be no more business cycles. See: <a href="http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Austrian_Business_Cycle_Theory">Austrian Business Cycle Theory</a>)<br>
<br>
&amp;gt; Austrian economics is a minority school, rarely taken seriously, and has been shown time and again to be removed from reality. They rarely use maths, models, evidence or the scientific method. It's about the most wishy-washy economic ideology out there.<br>
<br>
This is the hogwash the mainstream has been pedalling for 80 years now. It is simply staggering, simply flabbergasting, that anyone could label the Austrian school as "removed from reality." They are the most grounded, and real world oriented economic school out there....and it isn't even close. They have accurately predicted, and layed out in detail, the exact reasons for just about every major economic downtrun/crash over the last 100+ years. The Keynesians predictive track record, on the other hand, is pathetic. <br>
<br>
The Keynesians are the ones divorced from reality. It's the Keyensians who cling to their fallacious, nonsensical, overly complex mathematical equations and graphs. It's the Keynesians who bamboozle the public with terms like "The Multiplier Effect," "The IS/LM model," and "sticky wages." It's the Keynesian, publically funded fellows who spend half their lives stuck in an office behind a desk researching and refining relatievly minute technical aspects of a theory grounded upon illogical fallacies who are divorced from reality.<br>
<br>
Austrians understand that the real world is a constantly evolving, constatnly changing environment, that reality and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Human-Action-Treatise-Economics-Volume/dp/0865976317/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1369675495&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=human+action">Human Action</a> is <em>subjective</em>, that numbers on a spreadsheet, or lines on a graph, cannot predict or demonstrate the complexities of the real world, and it's an insult to pretend that they can.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/randomfact8472</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/canada/">r/canada</a></div><div class="c_body"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU</a><br>

<br>
Its really too wide of a concept to provide evidence for in a simple fashion. At the same time it's easy enough to say that large sectors of the economy will be massively downsizing their human resource component while still meeting demand, while other sectors that are also currently meeting all demand don't need more people. Unless some magic new sector comes along to employ people in a way that robots or software can't accomplish, there will be massive structural unemployment.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Precaseptica</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/CapitalismVSocialism/">r/CapitalismVSocialism</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>History cannot possibly define potential.

<br>
The US isn't free market. Corporations get subsidized and protected. Ideas are patented and, for longer and longer terms, copyrighted, another form of government protection. Whole laws are invented to protect legacy corporations. New forms of business and ideas get blocks thrown in their way all the time.<br>

<br>
Not lower than it otherwise would have been. Just lower than if you do the accounting differently. If you give the poor services, then total their income+services, of course you get a bigger number than just totaling their income. <br>
<br>
But this doesn't tell you what would have happened in a universe where you never provided the services and had instead left the resources in the more productive parts of the economy. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt; there is still a clear benefit in these programs<br>
<br>
There's a benefit to <em>any</em> action. When you send people checks, they get richer. Doing drugs makes you feel great. Even plane crashes remind us how precious life is. What I'm disputing is whether your success metric is sensible and whether the hidden cost outweighs the visible benefit.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt; I challenge you to show me evidence that these programs had a significant role in halting the declining trend in poverty rates.<br>
<br>
Read some Theodore Dalrymple. I found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Bottom-Worldview-Makes-Underclass/dp/1566635055">Life at the Bottom</a> an eye-opener. He writes about the effects of the UK's welfare system, but ours <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QzIXygwSrk">isn't much different</a>.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt; a substantially lower percentage of the total federal tax revenue<br>
<br>
I was responding specifically to your claim about Social Security benefits. Its hidden costs are relatively easy to bring into the light, because its accounting is somewhat separate. <a href="http://tpcprod.urban.org/taxtopics/images/Payroll-Tax-Rate-Historical_6.gif">Payroll taxes</a> have in fact gone up quite a bit and are <a href="https://tinyurl.com/jk9kjdv">borne disproportionately</a> by the middle class.<br>
<br>
If you want to look at the bigger picture, you can't stop with federal tax but need to include state and local, which have risen the most and are the least progressive, as a good part of them take the form of sales and property tax. The <a href="http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/revenue_chart_1978_2016USk_17s1li011lcn_F0fF0sF0l">total tax burden</a> has tripled in real terms since 1979, while the workforce has grown by only about 50%. Workers are getting squeezed to pay for many things, but <a href="http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_1978_2016USk_17s2li011lcn_00t10t40t_Entitlement_Spending">baby boomers' retirements</a> are among the bigger items.<br></p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/aim_for_the_flattop</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/Conservative/">r/Conservative</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>I think you're not understanding my point that social welfare programs wouldn't be so broadly necessary if community<em>, religion and marriage hadn't been crippled so badly as the tent poles holding up our society, as least among those who receive government benefits. The government has stepped into the void to take care of people instead of people taking care of themselves, which they are far better equipped to do if they are socialized through the aforementioned institutions that you dismiss so cavalierly. And now that we have an entire underclass with no notion of or use for those institutions, the only option they have left is to rely on the government to support them. You might consider reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Bottom-Worldview-Makes-Underclass/dp/1566635055">this book</a> for an analysis of this phenomenon. <br>

</em>There's nothing inherently "leftist" about community as a concept; what an odd claim to make. Maybe you've never met any Mormons? Or a rural farming town? Or the old people in my town who square dance and play bridge and quilt and paint benches at the park together?</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/emfyo</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/Conservative/">r/Conservative</a></div><div class="c_body"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Bottom-Worldview-Makes-Underclass/dp/1566635055/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1374163753&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=life+at+the+bottom">Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass</a></p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/pennwastemanagement</span><span class="c_score"> · 1 point</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/AskSocialScience/">r/AskSocialScience</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Be careful on overestimating the whole death of the suburbs thing.

This is true even in the fastest gentrifying places like Chattanooga.<br>

&amp;gt;Bitcoin is breaking through a major level of resistance at $9k as the rally continues. This article looks to provide insights behind some of the key metrics and other fundamental aspects backing Bitcoin.<br>

&amp;gt;Remember, when we see a pump in price, it doesn't necessarily mean that one can pinpoint the reason fueling the higher valuation. A whole plethora of factors outside the public knowledge may influence such decision to buy the token, however, by analyzing the latest key fundamental advancements, we can assess how well justified the rise is.<br>

&amp;gt;<strong>#2 Social Media Hype Solid&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;<br>

&amp;gt;The social media activity via Twitter and Reddit on Bitcoin has been consistent since early April. We've drawn a line around 22.5k, which when broken, should provide further evidence that the hype is truly back.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;We like to use the website Solume.io illustrates the change in sentiment, as it helps us track the social activity on Reddit and Twitter.<br>

&amp;gt;</strong># 7 End of US Tax Season Clears the Path for Fresh Capital&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;"Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies could ease after tax day", those were the words from Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;Lee was quoted via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/crypto-rout-driven-by-25-billion-capital-gain-hit-tom-lee-says?cmpId=flipboard">Bloomberg</a> earlier in April:<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;"The April 15 income-tax filing deadline is contributing to cryptoâ€™s falling prices as investors who won big betting on the digital tokens sell some of their remaining holdings to pay $25 billion in capital-gains levies, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a note Thursday. Bitcoin dropped more than 40 percent over the past month, including a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday to $6,664 as of 9:39 a.m. in New York.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;â€œThis is a massive outflow from crypto to dollars,â€ Lee wrote. â€œHistorical estimates are each $1 of USD outflow is $20-$25 impact on crypto market value.â€ Lee says that $25 billion prediction -- derived from his estimate that U.S. households had $92 billion in taxable gains from cryptocurrencies in 2017 -- would represent 20 percent of capital-gains tax receipts to the U.S. Treasury. He estimates total capital gains receipts will hit a record $168 billion for tax-year 2017."<br>

&amp;gt;<strong>#8 Technical Breakout Sees Further Shorts Liquidation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;The area of resistance at $9k represents a major hurdle, so when it broke, some shorts saw their stops triggered which creates an initial flash-type move on the combination of shorts buying back to close their positions and new longs coming in.<br>

Here's an idea: Maybe people with a political ideology that favors more economic intervention are more likely to vote for policies of economic intervention that lead to housing shortages and costs rising.<br>

Being liberal doesn't mean average voters are always going to make good decisions, as much as r/pol would like to believe otherwise.

&amp;gt;From Publishers Weekly<br>
In this challenging report, social activist Rifkin (Biosphere Politics) contends that worldwide unemployment will increase as new computer-based and communications technologies eliminate tens of millions of jobs in the manufacturing, agricultural and service sectors. He traces the devastating impact of automation on blue-collar, retail and wholesale employees, with a chapter devoted to African Americans. While a small elite of corporate managers and knowledge workers reap the benefits of the high-tech global economy, the middle class continues to shrink and the workplace becomes ever more stressful, according to Rifkin.</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/scale10crazy</span><span class="c_score"> · 0 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/personalfinance/">r/personalfinance</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>Okay, people are saying no but I disagree.

Look for a multi property. I bought a duplex at 23 with 40k in debt and I'm doing way better then I was before I splurged on the buy. I get rent from my tenant and my mortgage is cheaper then what it would cost to rent. I would recommend a duplex that way if for some reason you can't pay your mortgage one month due to bills you have someone else paying you rent to help cover it. I would highly recommend not doing that if at all possible and using the extra income to build up a savings for repairs you're responsible for but after getting 10-15k in savings for repairs you can start taking the rental income to pay off your debt faster. <br>

<br>
Isso nem faz sentido. A propriedade privada pode ser transferida de uma pessoa para outra por contrato, mas não é criada por contrato. Se um pedaço de terra não tem dono, que tipo de contracto é que pode atribuir propriedade dessa terra a alguém?<br>
<br>
Se estiveres interessado em filosofias que defendem a liberdade contratual mas não necessariamente a propriedade privada, aconselho o livro "Markets, Not Capitalism": <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Markets-Not-Capitalism-Individualist-Inequality/dp/1570272425">https://www.amazon.com/Markets-Not-Capitalism-Individualist-Inequality/dp/1570272425</a><br>

<br>
O whataboutism é dizer que os outros não pode criticar porque também o fazem. Não estou a ver como se aplica aos meus posts.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt; E aliás, pegando no teu argumento, és comunista mesmo querendo liberdade contratual mas abolição da propriedade privada. É um conceito puramente comunista<br>

Lá está, e no entanto cumpre os critérios que tinhas definido originalmente.

I realized that you don't actually know anything about economics. That isn't an insult or me being flippant! Lots of people don't know anything about economics - it's called "the dismal science" for a reason. And lots of those people that know nothing about economics vote and have political opinions, because one is not a prerequisite for the other. So I'm not insulting you by saying that - it's just that no one who has ever stepped foot in an economics 101 classroom on the first day, opened en econ-related book of any kind, or even Googled the word "economics" would say that.<br>
<br>
So, instead of debating these specific points with you, I'm going to be as helpful as I can be. Here are the books you want to start with:<br>
<br>
Henry Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economics-One-Lesson-Shortest-Understand/dp/0517548232/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1373957729&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=economics+in+one+lesson">http://www.amazon.com/Economics-One-Lesson-Shortest-Understand/dp/0517548232/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1373957729&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=economics+in+one+lesson</a>)<br>

<br>
And Thomas Sowell's Basic Economics (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Action-Ludwig-von-Mises/dp/0865976317/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1373957777&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=ludwig+von+mises">http://www.amazon.com/Human-Action-Ludwig-von-Mises/dp/0865976317/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1373957777&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=ludwig+von+mises</a>)<br>
<br>
I don't mean to pile three books on you - honestly, you can just read one and get started (I would recommend Hazlitt to start). Once you have a bit more understanding of how things like GDP are calculated, how inflation affects purchasing power, how credit risk is evaluated, and so on, you'll have a better understanding of your own suggestion without needing me. Hazlitt isn't a long read - if you have an average amount of free time, you can probably be through it in a few weeks. I look forward to discussing it with you!</p></div></div><div class="c"><div class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/howardson1</span><span class="c_score"> · -1 points</span><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/politics/">r/politics</a></div><div class="c_body"><p>There is plenty of rent seeking regulation that helps big business that libertarians, liberals, and conservatives can all oppose.
