<p>Become informed about important facts regarding cryptocurrency lending including the types of crypto-loans and the risks involved.</p>



<h2>Cryptocurrency Lending Facts You Should Be Aware Of</h2>



<p>The cryptocurrency lending industry has really taken off in the last couple of years. For lenders crypto-loans offer a good return on their digital assets and they benefit borrowers by providing them with funds without having to sell their cryptocurrency holdings. There are numerous sites online where both borrowers and lenders can <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinlive.io/bitcoin-loan/" target="_blank">find services with instant Bitcoin loans</a> as well as for other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some people consider getting a crypto-loan to be pretty much the same as acquiring a loan from a bank. However, while there are some similarities, there are some <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinpedia.org/information/companies-accepting-xrp-pay-using-ripple/" target="_blank">differences between crypto-lending and traditional lending</a>. For those not familiar with cryptocurrency lending we have provided some facts about the service.</p>



<h2 id="h-there-are-two-main-categories-of-cryptocurrency-loans"><strong>There Are Two Main Categories of Cryptocurrency Loans</strong></h2>



<p>There are two main categories that cryptocurrency loans will fall into; centralized loans, also known as custodial or CeFi loans and decentralized or DeFi loans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With centralized loans the lending platform sets the loan terms and interest rates. Borrowers and lenders must go through a KYC verification process. The lending platform will also have access to the user’s private keys. Loans from centralized platforms can be in cryptocurrency, stable coins or fiat currency. Interest rates tend to be lower on centralized loans and the lending platform is more user friendly.</p>



<p>Decentralized loans are managed by smart contracts. The lender sets the interest rates and it is up to the borrower whether or not they accept. Interest rates on DeFi loans will generally be higher. Both borrower and lender maintain control of their cryptocurrency assets but if a loan payment is missed, the lender can take action against the borrower’s account. Loans from DeFi platforms can be in cryptocurrency or stable coins but not fiat currency.</p>



<h2 id="h-cryptocurrency-loans-don-t-require-a-credit-check"><strong>Cryptocurrency Loans Don’t Require a Credit Check</strong></h2>



<p>Anybody who has ever applied for a loan from a bank knows that there is a huge amount of paperwork involved which includes an extensive credit check. This is not the case with cryptocurrency loans. Users of centralized crypto lending platforms will have to complete a KYC verification process but there is no credit check. DeFi platforms don’t even require users to complete the KYC process.</p>



<p>The only requirement to qualify for a crypto-loan is to provide the necessary collateral. Once the borrower provides the collateral, loan approval is complete in anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on the particular platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-be-familiar-with-the-loan-to-value-ltv-ratio"><strong>Be Familiar with the Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio</strong></h2>



<p>The Loan to Value or LTV ratio determine how much collateral a borrower must provide and along with the type of cryptocurrency used as collateral and the length of the loan term influences interest rates.</p>



<p>LTV is the amount of the loan divided by the amount of the borrower’s collateral. For example, if a loan of $1000 requires collateral worth $2000 the LTV is 50%.</p>



<ul>
<li>$1000 (loan amount) / $2000 (collateral) = 50% (LTV)</li>
</ul>



<p>To determine the amount of collateral required for a loan multiply the amount of the loan times the LTV.</p>



<ul>
<li>$1000 (loan amount) x 50% (LTV) = $2000</li>
</ul>



<p>Cryptocurrency loans are generally always over-collateralized meaning that the amount of collateral will be higher than the amount of the loan. Depending on the lending platform, the LTV will range from 20% to 90%. The lower the LTV the lower the amount of interest that will be charged.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-all-cryptocurrencies-are-eligible-as-collateral"><strong>Not All Cryptocurrencies Are Eligible as Collateral</strong></h2>



<p>There are around 20,000 different cryptocurrencies with over 10,000 of those being active. However, most lending platforms will only accept a small number of these as collateral for a cryptocurrency loan. Most platforms will accept the popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and a number of others. A number of stable coins such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://tether.to/en/" target="_blank">Tether</a>, USD Coin and Binance USD are also widely accepted. Some lending platforms accept as many as 50+ different cryptocurrencies and stable coins as collateral while others only accept 4 or 5. If you are holding a somewhat unknown cryptocurrency, you may have a difficult time finding a platform that accepts it or may even have to trade it for a different digital coin.</p>



<h2 id="h-there-are-some-risks-involved-with-cryptocurrency-lending"><strong>There Are Some Risks Involved with Cryptocurrency Lending</strong></h2>



<p>Those considering becoming involved with crypto-lending should be aware that there are some risks involved. Cryptocurrencies are volatile and borrowers may be subject to margin calls if they experience a drop in the value of their collateral and the LTV dips below that agreed on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also little or no regulation of the crypto-lending industry. The level of regulation depends on your location. For example, crypto-lending in the U.S. may be somewhat different than that in other countries. Without the strict insurance requirements imposed on traditional banks by regulation, lending platforms can be subject to problems like those recently experienced by Celsius who was forced to pause all account withdrawals.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency lending can be a great tool in your investment strategy but make sure to do your research first.</p>

including the types of crypto-loans and the risks involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCryptocurrency Lending Facts You Should Be Aware Of\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe cryptocurrency lending industry has really taken off in the last couple of years. For lenders crypto-loans offer a good return on their digital assets and they benefit borrowers by providing them with funds without having to sell their cryptocurrency holdings. There are numerous sites online where both borrowers and lenders can \u003ca href=\"https://coinlive.io/bitcoin-loan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003efind services with instant Bitcoin loans\u003c/a\u003e as well as for other cryptocurrencies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome people consider getting a crypto-loan to be pretty much the same as acquiring a loan from a bank. However, while there are some similarities, there are some \u003ca href=\"https://coinpedia.org/information/companies-accepting-xrp-pay-using-ripple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"\u003edifferences between crypto-lending and traditional lending\u003c/a\u003e. For those not familiar with cryptocurrency lending we have provided some facts about the service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-there-are-two-main-categories-of-cryptocurrency-loans\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere Are Two Main Categories of Cryptocurrency Loans\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two main categories that cryptocurrency loans will fall into; centralized loans, also known as custodial or CeFi loans and decentralized or DeFi loans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith centralized loans the lending platform sets the loan terms and interest rates. Borrowers and lenders must go through a KYC verification process. The lending platform will also have access to the user’s private keys. Loans from centralized platforms can be in cryptocurrency, stable coins or fiat currency. Interest rates tend to be lower on centralized loans and the lending platform is more user friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDecentralized loans are managed by smart contracts. The lender sets the interest rates and it is up to the borrower whether or not they accept. Interest rates on DeFi loans will generally be higher. Both borrower and lender maintain control of their cryptocurrency assets but if a loan payment is missed, the lender can take action against the borrower’s account. Loans from DeFi platforms can be in cryptocurrency or stable coins but not fiat currency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-cryptocurrency-loans-don-t-require-a-credit-check\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCryptocurrency Loans Don’t Require a Credit Check\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnybody who has ever applied for a loan from a bank knows that there is a huge amount of paperwork involved which includes an extensive credit check. This is not the case with cryptocurrency loans. Users of centralized crypto lending platforms will have to complete a KYC verification process but there is no credit check. DeFi platforms don’t even require users to complete the KYC process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe only requirement to qualify for a crypto-loan is to provide the necessary collateral. Once the borrower provides the collateral, loan approval is complete in anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on the particular platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-be-familiar-with-the-loan-to-value-ltv-ratio\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe Familiar with the Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Loan to Value or LTV ratio determine how much collateral a borrower must provide and along with the type of cryptocurrency used as collateral and the length of the loan term influences interest rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLTV is the amount of the loan divided by the amount of the borrower’s collateral. For example, if a loan of $1000 requires collateral worth $2000 the LTV is 50%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e$1000 (loan amount) / $2000 (collateral) = 50% (LTV)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo determine the amount of collateral required for a loan multiply the amount of the loan times the LTV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e$1000 (loan amount) x 50% (LTV) = $2000\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrency loans are generally always over-collateralized meaning that the amount of collateral will be higher than the amount of the loan. Depending on the lending platform, the LTV will range from 20% to 90%. The lower the LTV the lower the amount of interest that will be charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-not-all-cryptocurrencies-are-eligible-as-collateral\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot All Cryptocurrencies Are Eligible as Collateral\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are around 20,000 different cryptocurrencies with over 10,000 of those being active. However, most lending platforms will only accept a small number of these as collateral for a cryptocurrency loan. Most platforms will accept the popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and a number of others. A number of stable coins such as \u003ca href=\"https://tether.to/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"\u003eTether\u003c/a\u003e, USD Coin and Binance USD are also widely accepted. Some lending platforms accept as many as 50+ different cryptocurrencies and stable coins as collateral while others only accept 4 or 5. If you are holding a somewhat unknown cryptocurrency, you may have a difficult time finding a platform that accepts it or may even have to trade it for a different digital coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-there-are-some-risks-involved-with-cryptocurrency-lending\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere Are Some Risks Involved with Cryptocurrency Lending\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose considering becoming involved with crypto-lending should be aware that there are some risks involved. Cryptocurrencies are volatile and borrowers may be subject to margin calls if they experience a drop in the value of their collateral and the LTV dips below that agreed on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also little or no regulation of the crypto-lending industry. The level of regulation depends on your location. For example, crypto-lending in the U.S. may be somewhat different than that in other countries. Without the strict insurance requirements imposed on traditional banks by regulation, lending platforms can be subject to problems like those recently experienced by Celsius who was forced to pause all account withdrawals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrency lending can be a great tool in your investment strategy but make sure to do your research first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimer: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a guest post.

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index makes an assessment of the dominant mood on the market, so the psychological factor is also taken into account. |br| The atmosphere of Fear, for example, drives many investors to panic and sell their crypto assets. This is a potential buying opportunity. |br| While the times of Greed, on the contrary, foster a certain recklessness in investment decisions. Potentially, they indicate that the market will be down soon. |br| Checking the index to find out where we currently stand psychologically is a good way to avoid common pitfalls and make wiser investment decisions – decisions that will pass the test of time.","fear_and_greed_faq_title2":"How Is Fear \u0026 Greed Calculated","fear_and_greed_faq_desc2":"The volatile crypto market is in fact guided by the psychological currents running underneath it. So, how do we go about calculating the fear \u0026 greed in the air? The psychological backdrop of the crypto market finds its reflection in a number of mediums, from social media posts to Google Trends. The market itself, when interpreted in combination with data from those outside mediums, can tell us a lot about the investing environment. Our Fear \u0026 Greed Index takes into account all those factors and, assigning them respective weight, molds them into one unified result. These are the factors that make up the Fear \u0026 Greed index","fear_and_greed_faq_title3":"Current Volatility","fear_and_greed_faq_desc3":"A rise in volatility contributes to the rise of fear in the market. To measure the volatility, we make respective comparisons to the average volatility value of Bitcoin in the previous 30 and 90 days. On the other hand, if we notice that volatility is falling, we assume the market's general mood is shifting more toward Greed. 25% of the index's result is based on this parameter.","fear_and_greed_faq_title4":"Momentum/Volume of the Market","fear_and_greed_faq_desc4":"When we see that the buying volumes are unusually high in the market, we conclude that there is an atmosphere of greed. The way we calculate the momentum/market volume is similar to the way we calculate the previous factor: We compare the current stats to the average of the last 30 days and 90 days. 25% of the end results is based on this factor.","fear_and_greed_faq_title5":"Social Media Posts","fear_and_greed_faq_desc5":"Monitoring hashtags of various coins on Twitter, we conclude that there is a tilt toward Greed when the hashtags get high interaction rates. It means interest in this or that coin is on the rise. On the contrary, when those numbers are falling, we assume the market is entering Fear territory. This factor carries about 15% weight of the end result","fear_and_greed_faq_title6":"Surveys","fear_and_greed_faq_desc6":"Asking people what they think of the crypto market directly is quite effective. That's why surveys are yet another aspect of the Fear \u0026 Greed Index. Typically, each survey gets anywhere between 2000 and 3000 votes. The opinions expressed in weekly surveys make up around 15% of the result.","fear_and_greed_faq_title7":"Bitcoin Dominance","fear_and_greed_faq_desc7":"If the dominance of Bitcoin is rising, that means that people are cautious about their crypto choices. In the atmosphere of Greed, investors are more open to experimenting with altcoins, as they hope one of those coin will make it big. On the other hand, in the times of Fear, they tend to stick with what they know, limiting risk. Bitcoin dominance contributes to the index by around 10%.","fear_and_greed_faq_title8":"Google Trends","fear_and_greed_faq_desc8":"The data about the search queries of users regarding Bitcoin can tell us a lot about the general atmosphere in the market. For example, if a growing number of queries include \"Bitcoin price manipulation,\" we interpret this as a sign of fear. On the other hand, if queries such as \"How to buy crypto\" are becoming more and more frequent, we're in for Greedy times. About 10% of the index's result is based on Google Trends.","fear_and_greed_faq_title9":"How to Use Fear and Greed Index or What to Use It For","fear_and_greed_faq_desc9":"If you're about to make an investment decision, but are unsure just how much that decision is affected by the general atmosphere of Fear or Greed on the market, checking the index can be quite helpful. |br| The Fear Index era is all about selling, so valuable assets are sometimes \"thrown out with the bathwater.\" In contrast, the Greed Index era is characterized by careless investments in assets the value of which is overblown. |br| The Fear and Greed Index is just another tool to support your decision-making process.","fear_and_greed_faq_title10":"How Often Do We Update Crypto Fear and Greed

The loss is called impermanent because users can recover the loss if the token pair goes back to the initial exchange rate: the loss will be realized only upon withdrawal.
