Your funds on deposit will continue to earn dividends. Share Secured loans have terms of up to 84 months.</p>
             <h3><a name="consenttopledge" id="consenttopledge"></a>Consent to Pledge</h3>

             <h3><a name="sharedraft" id="sharedraft"></a>Share Draft/ATM Overdraft Protection</h3>
               <p>Overdraft protection kicks in when you don’t have enough in your share draft (checking) account to cover a check or electronic transaction.  Rather than us returning your check NSF (nonsufficient funds), we pay the check and pull from your overdraft loan.
