<br>
This occurs in 2140 so shouldn't be much of a concern outside of a speculative hypothetical , but removing all monetary inflation for a product in demand means that bitcoin will likely keep appreciating in value.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;How is value determined outside speculation when it's not tied to anything tangible.<br>
<br>
Supply and demand is what determines the price for all goods and services irrespective if its digital or physical(tangible). Bitcoin has intrinsic value as well, much akin to twitter and the internet having intrinsic value. Bitcoin is a very useful tool that allows people to exchange value for high risk transactions. There is a circular economy and inelastic demand of users for bitcoin that give it value. States indirectly subsidize this value in bitcoin and will continue to as long as laws and regulations exist.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;\&amp;gt; Also, a gallon of milk could cost 1btc or .0001btc<br>

<br>
more likely referred to as "2 bits" in the future<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;\&amp;gt; you can fragment a bitcoin as small as you want? So does a supply cap even matter?<br>
<br>
Yes , sub satoshis already exist on the lightning network for microtransactions . This is not a form of inflation but further decimalization ... I.E... instead of 1 usd =100 cents , 1USD = 1,000,000 units of 1/1,000,000 a usd= 1usd without adding anything to the monetary supply. Adding more bitcoins into circulation is inflation lowering the value of everyones BTC , further dividing the unit decimalization does not have this effect.<br>

I use bittrex and coinbase and like them, but there are many options for exchanges. I live in Washington state, so I have less options because Kraken and Poloniex are not available here.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd recommend getting either a ledger nano s or trezor hardware wallet. I have a ledger and it's really cool. Others like the trezor, but I don't have experience with it. Look into both and figure out which one you like more. This is the most secure way to store many coins.<br>
<br>
<br>
This stuff is definitely worth the effort. I think it will be a multi trillion dollar market in five years, so it's still really early days. If you have a background in tech, then you have a good advantage in assessing the technology and making a lot of money investing. Good luck to you!<br>

Banks take reserves and loan them out, but are required to keep some amount on hand given reserve requirements. They can hold more reserves if they want, and this is called excess reserves.<br>
<br>
A one-time increase in reserves held by banks given to them by the Fed (this is called high powered money) causes an overall increase in the money supply higher than one-for-one (so 1 dollar turns into more than 1 dollar) thanks to a "money multiplier".<br>
<br>
In the 60s, it was theorized that the money multiplier was 1/1-rr (where rr is the required reserve ratio). It's a bit more complicated than that now, but the idea stays the same: an injection of high powered money can increase the amount of money in the system more than just the initial amount of money. From Hubbard and O'Brien's book that I reference below there's an <a href="https://faculty.unlv.edu/bmalamud/ad.304.ch14.money%20creation.ppt" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to alternative and more realistic model">alternative and more realistic model</a> of the money multiplier (warning: power point download).<br>
<br>

<br>
However, the Fed doesn't target the money supply, it targets inflation. To change inflation it just adjusts interest rates by swapping bonds for reserves in the Fed Funds market. This increases the money supply. Through this increase in the money supply, the Fed suppresses real interest rates and increases the quantity demand of loans, which increases real output. So, through an interest rate channel, chg(M)-&amp;gt;chg(output).<br>
<br>
This has an impact on real variables, despite what <del>9/11 truthers</del> MMTers would have you believe. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3o0o8p/bad_monetary_economics/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to See my R1 of MMT here">See my R1 of MMT here</a>, along with exceptional comments by /u/Integralds.<br>

&amp;gt;Remember, when we see a pump in price, it doesn't necessarily mean that one can pinpoint the reason fueling the higher valuation. A whole plethora of factors outside the public knowledge may influence such decision to buy the token, however, by analyzing the latest key fundamental advancements, we can assess how well justified the rise is.<br>

&amp;gt;</strong># 7 End of US Tax Season Clears the Path for Fresh Capital&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;"Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies could ease after tax day", those were the words from Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.<br>

&amp;gt;Lee was quoted via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/crypto-rout-driven-by-25-billion-capital-gain-hit-tom-lee-says?cmpId=flipboard" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Bloomberg">Bloomberg</a> earlier in April:<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;"The April 15 income-tax filing deadline is contributing to cryptoâ€™s falling prices as investors who won big betting on the digital tokens sell some of their remaining holdings to pay $25 billion in capital-gains levies, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a note Thursday. Bitcoin dropped more than 40 percent over the past month, including a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday to $6,664 as of 9:39 a.m. in New York.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;â€œThis is a massive outflow from crypto to dollars,â€ Lee wrote. â€œHistorical estimates are each $1 of USD outflow is $20-$25 impact on crypto market value.â€ Lee says that $25 billion prediction -- derived from his estimate that U.S. households had $92 billion in taxable gains from cryptocurrencies in 2017 -- would represent 20 percent of capital-gains tax receipts to the U.S. Treasury. He estimates total capital gains receipts will hit a record $168 billion for tax-year 2017."<br>

<br>
No. We're all just a bunch of "lambo moon boys" and none of us have any formal study or experience in the world of economics. ^(/s)<br>
<br>
You do realise that this is a multi-billion dollar industry? A lot of very smart people have spent a lot of time and effort examining this from many angles.<br>
<br>
If you want a good introduction to what a world based on Bitcoin might look like, I'd recommend starting off with forgetting about Bitcoin specifically and first reading some of the basic works from the Austrian economists such as Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Once those concepts are in your head (whether you agree with them or not), then move on to "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to The Bitcoin Standard">The Bitcoin Standard</a>" by <a href="https://capitalism.columbia.edu/saifedean-h-ammous" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Saifedean Ammous">Saifedean Ammous</a> (which also spends over half the book not talking about Bitcoin before it finally does; for good reason).<br>
<br>
The reason I suggest to start off with the Austrian economists is that you need to first realise that you've got a lot of assumptions that might not necessarily be grounded in reality. One of the most common that I see for example is people saying, "<em>deflation is bad!</em>" as a general rule without further context. I agree that under our current economic model, deflation causes significant issues, but things that are true under our current model are not necessarily true under every model.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;Any experts that talk about the reality of Bitcoin adoption?<br>
<br>
As above, Dr Ammous is an economist with multiple degrees in relevant fields. I think he qualifies as at least one kind of expert.<br>
<br>
There's also myself, but since you don't know who I am and I have no intention of linking my pseudonym to my real name, any credentials I say that I hold are something you'd just have to trust me on, and I fully understand you have no reason to.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;And also, what will psychological make people trust a newly created digital asset class? It's untested.<br>
<br>
Everything new is untested and untrusted at some point and over time this changes. I've seen enough "new tech" in my lifetime to know that this really isn't such an issue.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;And whether true or not people will assume it's 'so-called' security will eventually be compromised as just about every technology becomes obsolete and has breaches. I'm talking public opinion.<br>
<br>
This is a combination of education and experience. Everybody knows that theoretically banks can get hacked, but they still trust their money to the bank. Even if they wrongly assume that Bitcoin is somehow able to completely compromised (and this definitely is wrong, because it's based on a false assumption of how the network operates), they only need to trust it to a similar or greater level than their bank in order to be willing to use it. And for that trust to be built, it only takes enough time of the system not being compromised.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Metalgear_ray</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bpdxy3/c/eo1b9w1/" target="_blank"> · 1 point</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/financialindependence/">r/financialindependence</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>That presupposes I'm interested in convincing you. You know it's funny, while your post inspired my initial response the reason I laid it out with the challenge at the end was to see if this community (well known as staunchly anti-crypto) could lay forth a convincing argument about why it would be wrong or why I should pull my money out. Perhaps something about the limitations of the technology, discussion of the effect of a recession or a potential black swan event I hadn't considered that showed someone had actually taken an objective look at the value proposition of bitcoin/cryptos and said I can't possibly add this to my portfolio. Instead what I mostly see are tired outdated talking points about crypto and ideology (index funds &amp;gt; all) of FI as outlined by people like MMM. There's nothing wrong with the principle tenets of FI and I follow them very closely but I also actively look at my portfolio to see how it can be enhanced or diversified through various investment instruments with varying levels of risk. Your OP represented to me that this sub would rather just not think about anything other than 3 fund portfolio index funds. Perhaps that's fine for the average person but I can't help but take a critical eye to everything I do with my money to maximize return while minimizing risk. Hence why I think bitcoin/crypto is worthy of discussion in this forum and further why I think it should be part of your portfolio (however small that may be). In any case, I find it humorous because we're coming from opposite ends where you say my argument is the 'least shitty' while I look at the likely thousands of people who have entered this topic and not one could provide a definitive argument of why my challenge is wrong or why I should not invest. It's almost disappointing that some of the smartest people on the planet gathered into this community with incredible foresight and outside the box thinking toward FI could not come up with something better.<br>
You in particular have offered less than nothing, implicitly agreeing that I am correct with my challenge and even outright trying to misinterpret the spirit of the question to somehow turn it against me. Sad, really but that's the state of things. Many will come around to this space when it's too late or not at all but I suppose that is their loss, not mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
In any case, if I were to indulge your supposed good faith inquiry as to why you should invest in bitcoin or otherwise, I would start by reading the white papers for Bitcoin and Ethereum. It will help you understand the first generation of a public blockchain as compared to the second generation which offers greater versatility than a simple digital distributed ledger.<br>
<br>
<br>
A good book to read on why cryptos are a good investment would be the one I linked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoassets-Innovative-Investors-Bitcoin-Beyond/dp/1260026671" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to below">below</a>. They highlight a lot of why an uncorrelated asset like bitcoin, despite the risk and volatility, actually reduces the risk of your overall portfolio.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you're interested in a professional trader's opinion, I would check out this video by Bob Loukas on the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWdOztDkv4&amp;amp;amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to bitcoin cycle">bitcoin cycle</a>". He specializes in asset bubbles and believes bitcoin operates like an emerging asset going through several cycles as adoption increases. It's tied to the economic policy built into bitocin via the halvening, cutting supply issuance in half per block every 4 years.<br>
<br>
Here's another interesting article for the case of a <a href="https://www.kanaandkatana.com/valuation-depot-contents/2019/4/11/the-case-for-a-small-allocation-to-bitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to small allocation of bitcoin">small allocation of bitcoin</a>.<br>
<br>
Searching youtube for Andreas Antonopoulos, he talks a lot more theory about why bitcoin is revolutionary.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are other resources of course but frankly I think we are wasting key strokes on one another. It is quite likely one of us will be thoroughly embarrassed in the next few years and I really don't think it will be me.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/kailey_hunter</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/7vnj9b/c/dtu18p5/" target="_blank"> · 5 points</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/litecoin/">r/litecoin</a></span><div class="c_body"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1484226038/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;psc=1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Blockchain Basics">Blockchain Basics</a> is probably the best high level overall business blockchain book, which focuses on proof of work mostly. <br>

<br>
Bitcoin has no main goal. It's just a ledger. It trustlessly moves tokens on a digital ledger between parties that don't trust each other. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt;Is there an endless amount of Bitcoin available to the world ie printing paper and susceptible to inflation/deflation? <br>
<br>
Bitcoin is deflationary. There will only ever be 21 million coins. A certain number are mined every 10 minutes. Every ~4 years the distribution amount halves (we call this the halvening). <br>
<br>
&amp;gt;“Okay I’m ready to buy some bitcoin but this site is charging a fee for my purchase”. Where is a good place to buy bitcoin from the U.S. without having to pay a fee?<br>
<br>
Limit orders on a professional exchange like Coinbase Pro or Gemini often have low/no fees. This is the best way to go about it. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt;What is the state of Bitcoin ie is it close to being recognized as a form of currency on the world stage and from governments? If not, what would it take for Bitcoin to surpass say an entire continents financial system and maintain a regular usage instead of paper notes?<br>
<br>
World governments are very differing in their positions on Bitcoin. Iran for example isn't a big fan. Venezuela's government isn't either, but their citizens are. The G5 countries are tolerating (and taxing) crypto earnings. The SEC is regulating some of the projects in the space. Merchants do accept it for payment, but the tax structure makes it harder to spend as a day-to-day currency currently. Calculating capital gains on every purchase of coffee is a PITA.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;Can Bitcoin handle Billions of people using the system for daily use? Is this where other crypto currency’s come into play to fill the void of an overloaded system?<br>
<br>
Right now? No. But Bitcoin is scaling up slowly. Other crypto currencies are mostly pump/dump scams that serve no real purpose. They would have issues scaling up to a large payment network without compromising decentralization. Check out the lightning network, segwit, schnorr signatures a bit technical, but you can find some great summaries. <br>
<br>
&amp;gt;Does Bitcoin become the “gold standard” and nations start to utilize hoarding Bitcoin or will it turn into nations valuing their own currency against Bitcoin like the world values everything against the USD? (If that last part makes sense)<br>
<br>
Here's a great book. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861">https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861</a><br>

I had kind of a background on network security and cryptography (although not at the level to be a Bitcoin developer myself, unfortunately...).<br>
<br>
I first heard about Bitcoin on the <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/security-now" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Security Now">Security Now</a> podcast probably in 2013 and completely ignored it. I didn't know anything about investing, money or the economy so I just didn't care.<br>
<br>
Later in 2015/2016 I started to hear about it again. I was starting to get interested in economy, finance, valuation and all that stuff. So I've tried to read the wikipedia article about Bitcoin and didn't understand any of it. Public ledger and all that stuff...<br>
<br>
Then finally I've stumbled on the original <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Bitcoin whitepaper">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>. Read it. Loved it. <br>
<br>
I was lucky enough to have just enough background in cryptography to understand it. It's very well written, very easy to read. You should read it if you haven't done it already. I believe you only need to have an idea of what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to hash function">hash function</a> is and what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to public key cryptography">public key cryptography</a> is to understand it pretty well.<br>
<br>
Then I've started to dive into the question of "What is money?". Everyone will have a different opinion on it. In my opinion money is just a technology to help people make transactions and if possible to store some value that can be used in the future...<br>
<br>
I've read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to The Bitcoin Standard">The Bitcoin Standard</a> which is kind of interesting and the famous post <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Shelling Out: The Origins of Money">Shelling Out: The Origins of Money</a> by Nick Szabo which some people believe might be the real Satoshi Nakamoto.<br>
<br>
I really don't care if some economists believe that money needs "intrinsic value" or it needs to be "backed" by something. If you are trading it for goods and services and you can store it it is some sort of money. <br>
<br>
And then there are some properties that makes some money more desirable than another.<br>
<br>
Some of the properties of Bitcoin are very similar to the properties that make gold a good store of value. It is kind of neutral, nobody controls it, there's a limit amount of it. But it adds a lot of stuff that can make it better than gold:<br>
<br></p>
<ul>
<li>It's digital.<br></li>
<li>Easier to transact.<br></li>
<li>Easier to transport.<br></li>
<li>Easier to conceal.<br></li>
<li>You can travel with millions in Bitcoin without being noticed, without putting yourself or your family at risk (just imagine if you're running from war in your country)<br></li>
<li>Easier to prove you own it.<br></li>
<li>Easier to prove it's real and not a counterfeit.<br></li>
<li>When demand goes higher you can't create more supply of it. (You can produce more physical gold by using more miners and machines when demand goes higher. But you can't create more Bitcoins/time)<br></li>
<li>You are not dependent on monetary policies that change over time and might be subject to political and social influence. The monetary policy was defined on its creation. No one can change it.<br></li>
<li>Bitcoins stock-to-flow will be greater than gold on the next halving. And will keep doubling every 4 years.<br>
<br>
I can certainly remember some more properties that make it more interesting than gold. But of course it doesn't have the track record. It just didn't exist 1000 year ago... It is not a good electrical conductor and it is not shinny and beautiful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯<br>
<br>
Bitcoin might not work out but it looks like a good asymmetrical bet to take. Gold current market cap is around $7 Trillion. Bitcoin's market cap is around $150 Billion...</li>

G. Edward Griffin, the author of the bestselling The Creature from Jekyll Island and a long-time Federal Reserve researcher, explains:<br>
<br>
"We pick up the story, appropriately enough, under cover of darkness. It was the night of November 22, 1910, and a group of the richest and most powerful men in America were boarding a private rail car at an unassuming railroad station in Hoboken, New Jersey. The car, waiting with shades drawn to keep onlookers from seeing inside, belonged to Senator Nelson Aldrich, the father-in-law of billionaire heir to the Rockefeller dynasty, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. A central figure on the influential Senate Finance Committee where he oversaw the nation’s monetary policy, Aldrich was referred to in the press as the “General Manager of the Nation.” Joining him that evening was his private secretary, Shelton, and a who’s who of the nation’s banking and financial elite: A. Piatt Andrew, the Assistant Treasury Secretary; Frank Vanderlip, President of the National City Bank of New York; Henry P. Davison, a senior partner of J.P. Morgan Company; Benjamin Strong, Jr., an associate of J.P. Morgan and President of Bankers Trust Co., and Paul Warburg, heir of the Warburg banking family and son-in-law of Solomon Loeb of the famed New York investment firm, Kuhn, Loeb &amp;amp; Company. The men had been told to arrive one by one after sunset to attract as little attention as possible. Indeed, secrecy was so important to their mission that the group did not use anything but their first names throughout the journey so as to keep their true identities secret even from their own servants and wait staff. The movements of any one of them would have been reason enough to attract the attention of New York’s voracious press, especially in an era where banking and monetary reform was seen as a key issue for the future of the nation; a meeting of all of them, now that would surely have been the story of the century. And it was. Their destination? The secluded Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia, home to the prestigious Jekyll Island Club whose members included the Morgans, Rockefellers, Warburgs and Rothschilds. Their purpose? Davison told intrepid local newspaper reporters who had caught wind of the meeting that they were going duck hunting. But in reality, they were going to draft a reform of the nation’s banking industry in complete secrecy."<br>

I've had a few chats where I tried to educate and share but realized the other person never really researched it much and just kept repeating the same common myths over and over again. "It's a ponzi" "Tulips" "Miners control it" "Same as any other coin" "too slow for coffee" "Criminals" etc, etc without the slightest interest in putting some time to check the facts.<br>
<br>
Now and then, someone appears and really wants to learn, which can be satisfying. I'm still learning a lot and also dismissed it as nonsense years ago (wasted time), but at least never claimed to be sure before researching - it was more of a "Meeehhh don't think so, seems nonsense" and that was it. it's fine to be skeptical, I am too, but I don't think it is fine to dismiss things so publicly with these claims, without putting any time into validating them. That is noise. Fake news.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course it doesn't help that the "Crypto" scene is full of scams and absolute nonsense. I'm not into "crypto" or "blockchain" in general anymore because with time I realized only BTC (the oldest, longest original chain) was worth taking seriously. All the other tokens/shitcoins are an absolute waste of resources in almost all cases.<br>
<br>
If you're curious, I'd recommend checking out these three sources for a start, as they are technically competent and legit:<br>
<br>

The learning curve is steep, but very rewarding. After just a bit you won't be producing these posts anymore because they won't feel accurate. That doesn't mean BTC is flawless or guaranteed to succeed, it's still highly experimental, but certainly not the nonsense some claim it to be before looking into it.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/EB_FIRE</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8lfuau/c/dzfix1r/" target="_blank"> · 2 points</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/cscareerquestions/">r/cscareerquestions</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>Interesting.<br>

The issue for you here is that BI is really just expected to know SQL, Excel, and Tableau. Maybe some very light programming in R or SAS; but honestly if you knew python reasonably well you would probably have a major advantage over everyone else in most BI departments. I imagine your company changed titles for this exact reason when they realized they didn't need the full skillset of a data scientist/analyst (or didn't want to pay for it). Anyway, most of this stuff is not directly applicable to blockchain so even though you would hypothetically have more credibility simply by the fact you are working with technology, I don't know if it would necessarily give you enough to make the jump to blockchain. An equal concern would be you getting the experience necessary to do so which as I mentioned is not likely.<br>
<br>
Of course if you really feel this is your best way to move into tech then by all means go for it. But if I were in your shoes, I would take a second look at cloud. Building cloud based applications will give you experience that is very directly applicable to what you are trying to do. There's also more ways into cloud than data. You can come in through a lower end web/frontend role or even a devops/admin role. There's a lot of resources and employers are more willing to hire 'unconventional' candidates because they need more bodies coding. You can get by with self-learning and then build something eye catching.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if you have seen this already but you might look into this book:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1527055715&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=blockchain+python" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to https://www.amazon.com/Mastering\-Bitcoin\-Programming\-Open\-Blockchain/dp/1491954388/ref=sr\_1\_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1527055715&amp;amp;amp;sr=8\-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=blockchain\+python">https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1527055715&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=blockchain+python</a><br>
<br>
I have read parts of it and it seems very good. It approaches the topic from a programming perspective though, but after you learn python it could be useful to you to align your knowledge of coding with blockchain.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Rekinom</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/Blackfellas/comments/4lkgvw/c/d3onlxr/" target="_blank"> · 1 point</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/Blackfellas/">r/Blackfellas</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>My main attempted ventures were foreign currency exchange.

No worries mate, if you could read everything and understand everything then you would literally be an economist at an investment bank! But, if you read even half of it and understand even 10% of that, I'd say you are still better informed than other laypeople who only consume economic news as prepared by the news media. That is the real garbage clickbait, or worse, actual misinformation, and just knowing to avoid that is a big step forward. <br>
<br>
How to understand more ... I guess the short answer of getting a degree in a related field is a bit obvious, and I assume you are beyond that stage for whatever reason. If you accept that you are a layperson not in the field, cracking a book open is still a worthy option. The usual list of popular intro college level texts are easy to find (Mankiw, Hubbard, Mishkin, Bernanke, etc). I've actually thought about making posts of just one or two paragraphs from texts like these. Maybe I'll get around to it...<br>
<br>
One book category that is overlooked are biographies, most prominent Fed members will have one, and they write these things to give an accessible/public understanding of what they did in their career. It's a great way to hear their reasoning about things without getting bogged down in academic details. I'd call out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Term-Fed-Insiders-View/dp/B0091KCD50" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to this one">this one</a> as my favorite. <br>
<br>
There is another book category of pop-econ, or if done well, you could call them quasi-textbooks. Some are good, but unfortunately there can also be a lot of dumb filler material that should be avoided. One I'd call out as good is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Housing-Bubbles-Household-Modeling/dp/0521198097" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to this one">this one</a>, and also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fed-Watching-Making-Information-Financial/dp/0273630725" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to this one">this one</a>.<br>
<br>
In the long run though, you will need some news source. Knowing what not to consume is just as important as knowing what you should. My advice, don't consume general news media. Don't be one of the nutjobs who ends up posting on r/economics "Buy gold, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/baydha/more_than_half_of_americans_say_they_didnt_get_a/ekf70z5/?st=ju9050f9&amp;amp;amp;sh=7c3627ae" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to the collapse is imminent">the collapse is imminent</a>", or "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/baydha/more_than_half_of_americans_say_they_didnt_get_a/ekfig8j/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to We must fulfill our duties">We must fulfill our duties</a> for the coming revolution as required by the Creator", you don't wanna end up like that. <br>
<br>
This sub was meant to show what actual economists are saying about the economy, and how they look at things. Some sources are more accessible than others. But even skimming the ones you don't understand will still help. You can of course just pick out those sources you do like and follow those, the sidebar has a large number of sources collected for you. I'd say UBS and Center State Bank are good starting points. See also the sidebar link "National Economic Data Summary", this is a great description of all the major macro variables in one place. <br>
<br>
Hope this helps!</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/lordpanda</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7gmnkk/c/dqk78hx/" target="_blank"> · 17 points</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/worldnews/">r/worldnews</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>I find it interesting that so much people on here feast on the losses of others. <br>

<br></p>
<ol>
<li>Check out <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to pro.coinbase.com">pro.coinbase.com</a> and learn how to use it. You'll use the same credentials that you do on coinbase, but save a lot on fees.<br></li>
<li>Don't bother with all the alt-coins.<br></li>
<li>Start purchasing Bitcoin with each paycheck.<br></li>
<li>Read "The Bitcoin Standard" (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861">https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861</a>)<br></li>
<li>Get a hardware wallet (I recommend Trezor) and start storing your Bitcoin on it.<br></li>
<li>Research the benefits of decentralized exchanges, learn how to use one (I recommend Bisq), and if it meets your needs, start using it as soon as possible.<br></li>
<li>Read "Mastering Bitcoin" (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Unlocking-Digital-Cryptocurrencies/dp/1449374042" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Unlocking-Digital-Cryptocurrencies/dp/1449374042">https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Unlocking-Digital-Cryptocurrencies/dp/1449374042</a>)<br></li>
<li>Develop a long term outlook, don't worry too much about price swings.<br>
<br>
From your post, it sounds like you might be interested in just trading. In that case, my suggestions won't help a lot. I think that the majority that try trading end up losing. If you do decide to buy/sell/trade, be sure to spend some time learning about trading, limits, stops, strategies, etc. Start small, win some, lose some, learn some, before going in big.</li>

This was one of the mandatory books at the Amsterdam University when studying banking. It is an excellent book dealing with most of the the issues you mentioned. It starts of with very simple and general questions like "What is money?" and goes all the way to complex issues like investment theories and transferring mechanism of central banks. The author really takes the time explain things with lots of comparisons and metaphors. I'd recommend this book to everyone looking to understand the financial markets and institutions.<br>

<li>If you want and introduction to financial instruments and derivatives I'd recommend: <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Global-Financial-Markets/dp/1137007524/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1375017793&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=an+introduction+to+global+financial+markets" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Valdez: An Introduction to Global Financial Markets">Valdez: An Introduction to Global Financial Markets</a></strong>. Don't let the name fool you. This book assumes you already have some basic knowledge of the financial markets. It tries to explain instruments and fluctuations in text and mathematical theories rather than in big images and examples like Mishkin does so some math skills would be advantage. The books focuses more on instruments and the theories behind them.<br>

&amp;gt; I'll tell you. Only these coffee purchases alone will instantly create at least a 220GB backlog in the BCH mempool. Which will take around 48 days (!) to clear with full 32MB blocks.

<br>
<br></li>
<li><strong>BCH:</strong> Now with <strong>only</strong> 50MB blocks those same Billion people could put their discretionary spends into a 2nd layer solution once a Month (your math) and perform as many tx's as they like during that month, <strong>while still being soverign over their own money.</strong><br>

<br>
<br>
The BTC future clearly is a custodial one for most people. BCH - jurys still out, I am not even against custodial solutions, I assume a hard money standard would still be a better system than what we currently have.<br>
<br>
<br>
I personally am not 100% convinced either way, Unforkable Ultrahard Money (BTC) or a money that can <strong>at this early stage</strong> still incorporate the best ideas of the space CTOR etc. eventually forking less and less until it too is unforkable. The latter being the better long term option imo, is the BTC protocol currently optimal? I am hedged either way are you?</li>

Depends how much you know about bitcoin though. Funny thing is, the exam requires payment in bitcoin only, and that is a test on its own. If you used bitcoin wallets to transact you are probably half way through. <br>
<br>
Here is the study guide<br>
<br>
<a href="https://cryptoconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CBPStudyGuide.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to https://cryptoconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CBPStudyGuide.pdf">https://cryptoconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CBPStudyGuide.pdf</a> <br>
<br>
You can just use this to research the internet to clarify those aspects you don't know. The generic questions such as what is money etc are easy. Concentrate on cryptography, mining and wallets, i.e. the technical stuff specific to bitcoin. <br>
<br>
The exam is mostly true/false choices, but pace is very fast. You have to answer questions within 16 seconds on average (20 minutes for 75 questions).<br>
<br>
If you use bitcoin on a regular basis you are probably a bitcoin professional without the exam.<br>
<br>
Andreas Antonopoulos, who is on board of this exam, can answer almost all your questions. Just google topics, and if you see one of his videos definitely watch it. Last but not least, if you read through his book Mastering Bitcoin you are good to go.<br>

Generally, things gain monetary value because of how hard they are to obtain or create. Bitcoin is the more pure form of decentralized digital scarcity that no other coin can replicate. Bitcoin will always have value unless someone finds a way to make it not scarce anymore. Things like commodities are essentially the same way, sunlight is useful for creating energy but because it isn't scarce it has no monetary value, but something like oil which require work to get from the ground and refine to make usable energy, it then has value because of its scarcity. Bitcoin is in the same vein where it creates a digital entity that is scarce while also being digital which was never done before without a controlling 3rd party.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/HetzerGer</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/clfgwy/c/evv2ri7/" target="_blank"> · 26 points</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/ethtrader/">r/ethtrader</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>I love it:<br>

Somebody needs to ground me again. I am so bullish while reading this book. Give it a try. I thought that I already read a lot and knew how to explain the Ethereum ecosystem and blockchain in general. I was wrong. This book is awesome. Easy to understand, great read, all general topics covered with many references and links for a further deep dive in the topic. <br>
I could convince monkeys to buy Ether after this read.<br>

<br>
Objectification is generally defined as something which treats a person as a thing. I haven't seen it refer to treating a relationship between persons as a thing. I assume you mean to highlight money's role in enabling objectification. While money does objectify some concepts, for example time, it does not objectify people. It can be utilized as an enabling technology which allows some humans to objectify others, but money is not doing the objectification. One could consider money a 'unit of objectification' if you will.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-objectification/#Con" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Martha Nussbaum (1995, 257) has identified seven features that are involved in the idea of treating a person as an object:">Martha Nussbaum (1995, 257) has identified seven features that are involved in the idea of treating a person as an object:</a><br>
<br></p>
<ul>
<li>instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for the objectifier's purposes;<br></li>
<li>denial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking in autonomy and self-determination;<br></li>
<li>inertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity;<br></li>
<li>fungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable with other objects;<br></li>
<li>violability: the treatment of a person as lacking in boundary-integrity;<br></li>
<li>ownership: the treatment of a person as something that is owned by another (can be bought or sold);<br></li>
<li>denial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as something whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.<br>
<br>
All of these features of objectification can be accomplished with or without money. When we consider money in and of itself to be the issue, we err, because money is a consequence of scaling up post-agricultural human societies, not the other way around. For example, slavery, which certainly most of us would agree is objectification, or requires objectification, is found in non-hunter-gatherer (agrarian) cultures where there is no money. Interestingly, hunter-gather societies rarely take slaves. Some semi-agrarian cultures, such as some Native American cultures, or tribes such as the Yanomamo feature violence and slavery, all without money. So, I conclude that it is post-hunter-gatherer human culture which creates objectification, as objectification so far has been a key element to scaling up human groups. We can certainly become more mature, aware, and sophisticated in our understanding of the deleterious effects which come with objectification, but it is not necessary to eliminate money in the process. I do think money could use some more thought though. And I have hope that some of the deleterious effects of money can be remediated by a more sophisticated approach to money as examined in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Money-Currencies-Scarcity-Prosperity/dp/1609942965" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to *Rethinking Money* by Lietaer, and Dunne."><em>Rethinking Money</em> by Lietaer, and Dunne.</a><br>

I hate to be a pessimist but I really feel like, the larger the group of people, the more uninformed the majority view will be. A mass audience of lay people when confronted with technical material just will not have anything to say. You could take the highest quality economic analysis and go to a shopping mall and wave it around, and the best possible outcome is people being silent and considering it. Listening to everyone's opinion is not going to teach you anything. <br>
<br>
Yeah for sure, my favorite casual audience book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Term-Fed-Insiders-View/dp/B0091KCD50" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to this one">this one</a><br>
<br>
For websites I am obviously partial to this subreddit =P The sidebar has many links to commentary straight from economists (a daily sample of which is posted as threads here), so if you read them over time you will gain a better understanding. The much more important point is to just avoid, avoid, avoid mainstream media and journalist attempts at covering economics. Sometimes it's just bad, but other times it is downright misinformation with political motivations. Journalists are not economists, they don't want you to remember that.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Malefiicus</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8i6se7/c/dyqozkm/" target="_blank"> · 0 points</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/CryptoCurrency/">r/CryptoCurrency</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>You're not wrong about a lot of that, but you're wrong on bitcoin. While it might not pay lots of dividends, I wonder exactly what % people gained simply from the forks, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and bitcoin diamond? Probably a lot more than any dividends in the stock market.<br>
<br>
Bitcoin is not at all bad as an investment, that's absurd. So is the "Maybe we're about to lose it all" stuff, it goes back to the 80% doesn't know anything about the tech statement you made. We know the US isn't banning it, we know China isn't banning it, we know Korea isn't banning it, we know Japan embraced it. The only risk to crypto, is that some quantum computer cracks it. That's not to say the price is guaranteed to go up over any short timeframe, it's just to address the often said, but always wrong assumption that there's some high probability of it going to 0. <br>
<br>
The tech behind all of this, will build the new internet, and it'll be based on tokens as a financial incentive which allows for decentralization, so long as the other tech exists, and BTC is the crypto you buy to access these tokens, BTC has a bright future. I'll again recommend my favorite book on crypto, <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Cryptoassets-Innovative-Investors-Bitcoin-Beyond/dp/1260026671?sa-no-redirect=1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to cryptoassets">cryptoassets</a>, it does a good job of explaining things in a way people can understand.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Darius510</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7fbj0y/c/dqaxlar/" target="_blank"> · -1 points</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/personalfinance/">r/personalfinance</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>Edit: Really?

<br>
It took me months before I felt like I actually <em>understood</em> it though. I've personally never come across a single person who understood blockchain/crypto enough to speak intelligently about it's intricacies but despite that still thought there was no place for it in the future. The hardest thing to wrap your mind around is how it isn't just a digitized version of traditional assets, yet it's hard to discuss with those unfamiliar with it without making comparisons to equities, commodities or currencies. But it doesn't quite fit into any of those boxes.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's a really good book to give you a broad overview. Then you can decide for yourself if you think they're the future or not. FWIW, I decided they were a few years ago and needless to say I do not regret making that decision.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/jlars221</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/9uyepr/c/e9842cg/" target="_blank"> · 4 points</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/BitcoinBeginners/">r/BitcoinBeginners</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>I really like Andreas antonopoulos’ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Money-Andreas-M-Antonopoulos-ebook/dp/B01L9WM0H8/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1541598180&amp;amp;amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;amp;amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&amp;amp;amp;keywords=the+internet+of+money&amp;amp;amp;psc=1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to The Internet of Money Series">The Internet of Money Series</a>.

That all changed with "The Internet of Money: Talks by Andreas M. Antonopoulos". This book changed the way I look cryptocurrency. I definitely reccomend it.<br>

<br>
There are many scholarly resources regarding (2). No so much (1), but you can find good leads in the footnotes to the Bitcoin white paper.<br>
<br>
If socially-minded, how about the role that financial privacy or trust plays in modern society and what Bitcoin's role is likely to be? This essay is packed with resources: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565</a><br>
<br>
If financially-minded, you might think about whether restricive money supply policies help or hurt the poor (or some group you might care about). There's a lot of academic research on that. Bitcoin offers a laboratory to test these ideas, and a lot has been written about this as well.<br>

&amp;gt;Hey, just a teen who uses bitcoin daily and just really interested in the world of cryptocurrency. Anyways, so summer is already here and I thought why not use this time to read up and learn more about cryptocurrencies.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;So after some researching I've come across these 2 books which Im thinking about buying: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Money-Andreas-M-Antonopoulos/dp/1537000454" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to The Internet of Money">The Internet of Money</a> , <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethereum-Blockchains-Decentralized-Autonomous-Organizations/dp/1523930470/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;amp;refRID=ZZQDMCZV7M4A5J72DHQT" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Ethereum: Blockchains...">Ethereum: Blockchains...</a> . However, I was wondering if these books are readable and understandable for non-technical people like me (no coding knowledge) and if you do/don't recommended it.<br>
<br>
&amp;gt;Also thinking about getting Mastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition and Mastering Ethereum later on when it comes out but I feel like those 2 books are really technical and I will not able to understand it. Any thoughts?</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/Scarface_74</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iziyv/c/dywsf86/" target="_blank"> · 1 point</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/Bitcoin/">r/Bitcoin</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>Everyone interested on the subject should read:<br>

Just diving into the code won't get you far, I'm afraid. Monero uses difficult cryptography and Bitcoin has been optimized for performance rather than readability. (By comparison: downloading the 6 GB Fastcoin blockchain, based on an older version of Bitcoin and Litecoin, took me two weeks.)<br>

<br>
I'd say the film is basically factual but tries to shock the viewer into questioning what they know of money by providing those conspiratorial overtones. Whether or not that's the most effective way to reach people is debatable for all but those who are prone to diving into conspiracies head first.<br>

The path I've seen people follow is -<br>
Getting an address and using a private wallet.<br>
Using and understanding how a hardware wallet works.<br>
Then playgrounding contracts in a private chain or Remix(online compiler), until they can make little tools.<br>

Fantastic read and just came out recently so quite relevant.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/JeffB1517</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/deh7o7/c/f2v4ztw/" target="_blank"> · 5 points</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/investing/">r/investing</a></span><div class="c_body"><p>I tend to think the r/investing crowd is too negative on many of the qualify closed end and open ended mutual funds out there. While the range of ETFs is exploding the mutual funds still offer a lot of diversity of product that just doesn't exist (yet?) for ETFs. That being said what you are describing here is a strategy called "performance chasing". An investor jumps into funds with really strong track records and stays in them while they continue to outperform. That sounds appealing and it sounds like it should work. In reality however that literally is one of the worst possible investing strategies around. It was a proven failure from the 1960s (gogo fund era) when open ended mutual funds became the primary non-real estate mainstream investment vehicle till the early 2000s when indexing and passive really came into vogue. As an aside for closed end funds it didn't work out well in the 1920s either. <br>
<br>
That's not to say you have to use cap weighted indexing exclusively. That's not to say you can't buy mutual funds from quality houses that specialize in particular skills. But the reason you are going to get a lot of negative feedback on the approach you are considering is that it a genuinely terrible strategy, though one that sounds initially appealing. <br>
<br>
What makes a mutual fund rack up a terrific record are often properties that can't or won't be repeated once the fund becomes popular. There are spectacular managers. The first no load open ended mutual fund manager, Thomas Rowe Price, being a terrific example. John Neff, Peter Lynch, Bill Nygren,Marty Whitman, Edward Johnson ... exist. But for every one of those there is a ton of Gerald Tsai's who crush the market using a strategy, accumulate a lot of assets and watch the strategy horrifically underperform because it just perfectly fit a certain point in time. The investors who performance chase, because they don't have an ideological commitment, get the later far more than the former. All the guys with the tremendous lifetime records had many years of underperformance. They were rarely the top 10 fund in any given year they just were consistently excellent across longer time periods. The investors who profited did so because they believed in the fund's strategies even when they didn't work out that year. <br>
<br>
Since performance chasing is a 1990s strategy I'll give you what at the time was probably the best first investing book at the time: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bogle-Mutual-Funds-Perspectives-Intelligent/dp/111908833X" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to Bogle on Mutual Funds">Bogle on Mutual Funds</a>. The book is a bit dated but he talks at length about why performance chasing is a terrible strategy providing lots of data and examples. While you probably aren't going to listen I'd strongly suggest you read this book before you try what you are about to try.</p></div></div><div class="c"><span class="c_header"><span class="c_author">u/YAKELO</span><a class="c_score" aria-label="View comment on Reddit" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9rk2i1/c/e8hfgxq/" target="_blank"> · 2 points</a><a class="c_subreddit" href="/r/CryptoCurrency/">r/CryptoCurrency</a></span><div class="c_body"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-Bitcoin-2e-Andreas-Antonopoulos/dp/1491954388/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1540555073&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=MASTERING+BITCOIN" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="link to https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-Bitcoin-2e-Andreas-Antonopoulos/dp/1491954388/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1540555073&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=MASTERING+BITCOIN">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-Bitcoin-2e-Andreas-Antonopoulos/dp/1491954388/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=1540555073&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=MASTERING+BITCOIN</a><br>

To the best of my understanding, during a taped on-stage talk given at the NYC Ethereal Summit [Friday, May 19th], William Mougayar said that "a traditional company with millions of users" is going to be announcing a token issuance on the public blockchain on May 25th at the Token Summit conference. I am presuming "public blockchain" is "Ethereum blockchain," inferred from context in which he spoke of other, earlier, smaller new companies issuing ICO tokens. (Obviously it's not the bitcoin blockchain.)<br>

I go with blockstreams green wallet. Beginner friendly.<br>

Buy bitcoin. Depends where you are. Try an ATM machine. Coinatmradar.com <br>
<br>
If you want to invest more, buy a hardware wallet. Never leave your coins online. Never save your mnemonic seed digital. Pen and paper. Only invest what you are willing to loose. <br>
